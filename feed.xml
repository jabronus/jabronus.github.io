		  <![CDATA[ <p>It’s been a minute! Work and family have been keeping me on my toes. Not to mention that since the last Roundup, I redesigned my site, released my <a href="/words/famicase-2023.html" target="_blank">Famicase entry</a>, and have been writing a talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/sensibleworld" target="_blank">Jory Raphael</a> to deliver at <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda?d=day-2&session=63f5c7f9-a504-487d-94fa-737c45865d1d" target="_blank">Config</a> next week! <em>(Also trying to exist across the hellscape of 3 separate text-based social media platforms — but that’s another topic for another post.)</em></p> <p>And of course in between all that I’ve been consuming a delicious and nutritious diet of new media.</p> <ul class="roundup"> <li class="book"> <p class="roundup-title">📖 <strong><em><a href="https://www.shortbox.co.uk/product/cuckoo-by-joe-sparrow-pre-order" target="_blank">Cuckoo</a></em> by Joe Sparrow</strong></p> <p>I’ve been a fan of Joe’s work ever since I started watching <em>Amphibia</em>. His previous graphic novel <em><a href="https://shortbox.gumroad.com/l/PrAcf" target="_blank">Homunculus</a></em> is also excellent, and both of them made me cry!

If you’re at all interested in video game development, I really can’t recommend the this documentary about <em>Psychonauts 2</em> enough. It’s a funny, heartbreaking, messy, amazing, and tactful look at the creative process—especially when a group of humans are involved.

		  <![CDATA[ <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year again, the <a href="https://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a>!</p> <p>I mentioned this briefly in the <a href="https://noahjacob.us/words/roundup-002.html" target="_blank">last Enjoyment Roundup</a>; but for more context, My Famicase is a little show put on every spring by Satoshi Sakagami of <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> gallery in Nishi-Ogikubo, Tokyo. Every year, folks from all over the world get to design brand new, imaginary games for the Super Famicom system (Japan’s version of the Super Nintendo) and have them displayed on physical cartridges for all to see! I’ve had the honor of participating in 3 previous exhibitions, but took last year off due to having zero extra creativity.</p> <figure><img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/dream-garden.png" alt="A fictitious Famicom cartridges on a black background. Title: Dream Garden Duo. Illustration of a futuristic couple holding hands and plants with scifi halos around their serene expressions."> <figcaption>A favorite past entry, <em><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/11226741-Dream-Garden-Duo-Famicase-2020" target="_blank">Dream Garden Duo</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/gelatinous-cubicle.png" alt="A fictitious Famicom cartridges on a black background. Title: Gelatinous Cubicle. A skeleton, desk, chair, computer, and papers float freely inside a green, glowing mass."> <figcaption>And another, <em><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/15561014-Gelatinous-Cubicle-Famicase-2021" target="_blank">Gelatinous Cubicle: Dungeon Bureaucracy Simulator</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/onus.png" alt="A triangle, semi-occult-ish logo with an a drowsy eye in the center. It’s got a shiny, holographic sticker look to it."> <figcaption>The logo for ONUS, my fictitious game developer</figcaption> </figure> <hr> <h2>A sweet & sticky space mystery</h2> <p>As with most of my previous entries, the idea for the name came first. I have a note on my phone where I workshop Famicase ideas throughout the year so that once I realize <em>“oh dang I better get started”</em> in February or so, I can get started without too much stress. <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em> (2021’s entry) was born from this list, and I’m excited about some promising candidates for forthcoming years 😎</p> <p><em>S’MARS</em> quickly rose to the top this time, but I needed to figure out <em>what it meant.</em> Would it be about a planet made of gooey, burned confectionary? Maybe some sort of saccharine puzzle game? Thankfully, a rewatch of <em>Sunshine</em> and a YouTube playthrough of the <em>Dead Space</em> remake coincided to give the idea some loose structure.</p> <p>As always, things start with some rough sketches. I typically do this only as long as it takes me to scratch out a few ideas or type lockups that I like.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/famicase-sketch.jpeg" alt="Two pages of a small, pocket-sized sketchbook filled with S’MARS doodles. Left: s’more schematic and general notes to myself. Right: title treatment ideas."> <figcaption>The messier, the better</figcaption> </figure> <h2>There’s something hungry out there...</h2> <p>I knew I wanted to do something with a sci-fi technical schematic look, with text overlaid using some sort of transparency or blending mode. I made the ship first, but it was a bit too complicated at first to have text reliably and legibly sit on top. But after 5 iterations or so, I hit a general layout and color scheme (inspired by NASA, ofc) that worked well.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/old-ship.png" alt="Black and grey vector line drawing of the s’more ship. It has a quasi-isometric side perspective, and too many solar panels and other details."> <figcaption>An initial pass at the ship</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/old-type.png" alt="Two vertically stacked, unfinished type examples for the game art. Top is very NASA-y, though only smells MAR at this stage. The bottom is a much more angular and rigid take, though abandoned after MA and some light grey spacing blocks."> <figcaption>Early type explorations</figcaption> </figure> <p>I remade and recolored my old Famicom cartridge vector template in Figma, and <em>voila!</em></p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/cartridge.png" alt="Off-white Famicom cartridge with navy blue, sky blue, and red art. The word S’MARS is overlaid atop a lined schematic drawing of a spaceship made of multiple modules and panel arrays arrange along a central axis. It seems reminiscent of marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers?"> </figure> <p>The final title treatment, especially, was a blast to develop. I knew I wanted something tech-y and somewhat interconnected, but earlier NASA-esque explorations didn’t pan out the way I wanted. Plus, the juxtaposition of such stark and rigid lettering and an ooey-gooey treat is kind of funny.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/final-type.png" alt="The tech-y, sci-fi title treatment I made for S’MARS — centered in solid white with outlined yellow versions radiating vertically off of it."> <figcaption>Thank you, have a nice day!</figcaption> </figure> <p>With Famicase entries, though, the art is only half of it. You’re also encouraged to write a short game description that will go onto the website and exhibition booklet. It could be anything, which is intimidating! But some of my aforementioned media consumption helped crystallize into this:</p> <blockquote><em>Mallow Core: offline. Graham Panel Array: unresponsive. Choc Strut Integrity: compromised. We’re 84 million miles from home, and there’s something hungry out there.</em></blockquote> <hr> <p>I could keep writing about this stuff for a while, but honestly I didn't document as much of the process or rejected concepts as I’d hoped 😅 If you’d like to read more sometime about these (like using extensive Figma components for the first time while making <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em>) or anything else Famicase-related, hit that email link below.</p> <p>💌 Find a mistake?

		  <![CDATA[ <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/job-awesome/fa-emboss.png" alt="embossed version of the Font Awesome flag logo on a gritty, purple-navy background"> <p>One year ago today, I started working at <a href="http://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>. I’d already been planning on writing a bit about the experience and how it’s been different; but last month, Lynn Fisher posted an <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/unordered-incomplete-list-of-things-i-want-from-a-job/" target="_blank">excellent list of things she wants from a job</a>. The earnestness of her words helped clarify my own thoughts and put some things in perspective.</p> <p>But first, a little background. I used to work remote at a Canadian design agency. In the last couple years out of my 7 working there, I regularly kept an ear to the ground about new opportunities. Judging by LinkedIn and <a href="https://read.cv/jabronus" target="_blank">read.cv</a> profiles, 7 years is an <em>eternity</em> in tech — so I suppose it makes sense that things started to stagnate. I had a terrific manager, but the company didn’t really know what to do with me as one of the only design specialists. Very much a “the clients love you and we value what you do” but also a “we forgot to promote you for the things you were already doing” situation. Anyway, I was tired of it. And thanks to Lynn’s list, it’s much easier now to identify some key things I felt were missing:</p> <ul> <li><strong><s>Work that benefits the people who receive it.</s></strong> Benefit is hard to gauge with super quick, 2-week engagements. You do your best, explain your work’s worth and how it fits into the larger project, and cross your fingers and toes that it’ll get used correctly (or at all).</li> <li><strong><s>A team small enough to know everyone personally.</s></strong> By the time I left, we were well over 100 spread across multiple departments and countries around the world. Upside: lots of diverse clientele & coworker experiences. Downside: it was impossible to know everyone, much less work with them. Kind of a rough deal in terms of remote working relationships. Plus, the specialist “team” was so siloed and haggard we couldn’t actually get together and plan how to address issues we all faced.</li> <li><strong><s>The autonomy to make small and big decisions about my work.</s></strong></li> <li><strong><s>The ability and opportunity to share my work publicly.</s></strong> NDAs blow.</li> <li><strong><s>Very few meetings, used effectively.</s></strong></li> <li><strong><s>Work that makes me come alive.</s></strong> Aside from all the rest, one of the final nails in the coffin was the company’s growing involvement in web3 and crypto client projects. I voiced my concerns about <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com" target="_blank">that whole disaster</a> multiple times but was still assigned to them anyway.</li> </ul> <hr> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/job-awesome/fa-playdate.png" alt="illustrated Font Awesome icon of a Pldaydate handheld console on a purple background. It’s positioned at a januty angle, and has a pixelated version of the Font Awseome logo on its black-and-white-screen."> <p>So one year in, has Font Awesome been different?</p> <p><em>A lot.</em></p> <p>We follow the tenets of <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup" target="_blank">Shape Up</a>, writing pitches and breaking work into digestible, 6-week chunks called “splits.” And in between these splits, we have 2-week cooldowns to work on fun things, fix random bugs, or learn new skills! A far cry from the blistering pace of agency client work. Let’s revisit some of that list:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Work that benefits the people who receive it.</strong> Everything at FA is based around icons, their implementation, and what our users and subscribers need — so I don’t need to constantly “sell” my skills or convince stakeholders that I belong at the table. Refreshing! Also being able to really dig in on something and tinker and revise until it works beats the heck out of fortnightly context whiplash.</li> <li><strong>A team small enough to know everyone personally.</strong> As of this writing, there are 18 of us. Even with everyone working remote, it's soooo much easier to build relationships when you can remember everyone's name. Plus we all <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/healthy-remote-work/" target="_blank">hang out</a> twice a year to noodle on new ideas, play D&D, and eat cookies.</li> <li><strong>The autonomy to make small and big decisions about my work.</strong> Everybody gets to have a say in what they work on. Pitches are written prior to each split outlining the planned work ahead and any foreseen potential pitfalls, and folks are welcome to help shape that direction and help hammer the scope down into something manageable.</li> <li><strong>The ability and opportunity to share my work publicly.</strong> I love talking about icons! I’ve done a fair share of written and video content about them in the past, and now I get to <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/add-some-class-with-font-awesome-sharp-icons/" target="_blank">keep</a> <a href="https://www.podcastawesome.com/2092855/12227182-nerd-show-and-tell-meet-noah-jacobus-senior-icon-designer" target="_blank">doing</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jabronus/109988072794511653" target="_blank">it</a>.</li> <li><strong>Very few meetings, used effectively </strong> I have about one meeting a week — that’s it. And it’s a pretty chill roundup of how everyone’s week has been.</li> <li><strong>Work that makes me come alive.</strong> I won’t go all Dani Rojas and say that “icons are life,” but I will say that working at Font Awesome has allowed all the parts of myself outside the 9–5 to more fully come alive. I haven’t had the Sunday Scaries once this past year. I’ve had spare creativity to use for freelance and side projects (like this blog!). Lower anxiety levels means better quality time with my family.</li> </ul> <p>Something our CEO Dave likes to talk a lot about is “work as a means to an end.” While it’s great to enjoy what you do for a living (and I’m incredibly blessed that I do), it should be just that: <em>for living.</em> Jobs should be tools to enable you to live the life you want when you’re not on the clock. (P.S. <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/hiring-a-product-designer/" target="_blank">We’re hiring!</a>)</p> <p>Cheers to one year and here’s to many awesome more ⚑</p> <hr> <aside>Thanks to Em for proofreading</aside> <p>💌 Find a mistake?

		  <![CDATA[ <p>More things have been enjoyed! I’ve also been tinkering with some style updates to the site and blog, but they’re not ready for primetime quite yet.

Every spring, designers from around the world get to make up brand new games as if they’d been made for the Super Famicom, then see their work displayed on actual cartridges in METEOR’s gallery space.

		  <![CDATA[ <p>So I’ve already been doing this for a bit <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1560695614165422080?s=20&t=m9_0JNscIE9z0zs6AcZVcw" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, but I figured a longer form version with additional context could be fun. I don’t really have a regular cadence for this in mind — basically whenever I’ve experienced enough different things across various media that pique my interest.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>📖 <a href="https://simpletype.co/products/twenty-bits-websites" target="_blank"><em>Twenty Bits I Learned About Making Websites</em> by Dan Cederholm</a></h3> <p>I’ve been a Dan Fan™ for a long while, and have really enjoyed his previous releases in this series. There’s lots of fun little nuggets, but as he says <em>“This is not a book about code.”</em> More of a trip down memory lane to the early days of web standards with some timeless lessons.</p> </li> <li> <h3>🎵 <a href="https://orcd.co/pollen" target="_blank"><em>Pollen</em> by Tennis</a></h3> <p>Sure the album doesn’t come out ‘til February 10, but I still keep listening to the same 2 released tracks over and over. I keep 2020’s <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tennis-swimmer/" target="_blank">Swimmer</a></em> on regular rotation as-is, so I can’t wait to for new Tennis tunes to fill my ear holes.</p> </li> <li> <h3>📺 <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/willow/PfeL8yCNXD3r" target="_blank">Willow</a></h3> <p>I didn’t grow up with Ron Howard’s 1988 original flick <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/willow/" target="_blank">Willow</a></em>, but I caught it as an adult a few years ago and found it quite charming (doesn’t hurt that Warwick Davis is always a win). I was worried this series would play the usual “soft reboot, same cast 30+ years later, *wink wink nudge nudge* nostalgia card” that’s plagued so many IPs lately; but my wife and I have really enjoyed it! Has its own tone and frequently made us laugh out loud.</p> </li> <li> <h3>⌨️ Tofu65 with <a href="https://modedesigns.com/collections/switches/products/anthracite-silent-tactile-switches" target="_blank">Anthracite Silent Tactiles</a></h3> <p>The trusty ol’ Tofu was my first real mechanical keyboard, and it’s still the most portable one I own. Because of that, it’s also the one I take with me to <a href="https://workthefactory.com" target="_blank">The Factory</a> on coworking days. I’m not a heavy typer, but I’m always keeping my ears on a swivel for making too much noise in public spaces. Lo and behold my delight when <a href="https://modedesigns.com" target="_blank">Mode</a>, some of my favorite keyboard folks, released a silent tactile switch for quiet clackin’. They’re surprisingly good stock, and I haven’t heard any complaints from my desk neighbors.</p> </li> </ul> ]]>

	  	<![CDATA[ <p>Well hello there, new friend. This blog may not look like much yet, but I wanted to get a space set up sooner rather than later for my forthcoming thoughts. And while the paint may change, the bones will stay the same — so why not go ahead and move in?</p> <p>Some potential posts coming down the pipe:</p> <ul> <li><strong>“Job Awesome”</strong> (reflections on one year at <a href="https://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>)</li> <li><strong>“Fundamentals of Icon Design v2”</strong> (cleaning up writing, new visual examples, dropping the MetaLab project narrative framing)</li> <li><strong>“Clicksy Business”</strong> (getting into the mechanical keyboard hobby)</li> <li><strong>“We Got the Chunk”</strong> (the ups, downs, and more ups of making and maintaining <a href="http://chunkicons.com" target="_blank">Chunk icons</a>)</li> </ul> <p>Anything else you’d like to hear about? Gimme a hearty shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus" target="_blank">The Bird</a>, <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jabronus" target="_blank">The Elephant</a>, or good old <a href="mailto:noah@noahjacob.us?subject=Writing in the Open">electronic mail</a>.</p> ]]>
