		  <![CDATA[ <p>More things have been enjoyed! I’ve also been tinkering with some style updates to the site and blog, but they’re not ready for primetime quite yet. I’d thought my design was pretty settled for a while, but as always <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/" target="_blank">Marcotte’s Law</a> holds true.</p> <ul class="roundup"> <li class="book"> <p>📖 <strong><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=The-Politics-of-Design" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Design</em></a> by Ruben Pater</strong></p> <blockquote>You are privileged. Just reading this sentence makes you part of the 85% of the world population that is literate, the 20% that understands English, and the 40% that has access to the internet.</blockquote> <p>I’m not quite all the way through yet, but it’s a both brisk and brusque read with a welcome tone. Adding Ruben’s <a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK" target="_blank"><em>Caps Lock</em></a> to my reading list next. </li> <li class="music"> <p>🎵 <strong><a href="https://boygenius.lnk.to/TheRecord/" target="_blank"><em>The Record</em></a> by boygenius</strong></p> <p>Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus are at it again. <em>No words, just listen.</em> Full album comes out March 31.</p> </li> <li class="website"> <p>🌐 <strong><a href="http://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a></strong></p> <p>The most wonderful time of the year is coming soon! Hosted by <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> in Nishiogikubo, My Famicase is a celebration of the Super Famicom game system (Japan’s version of the Nintendo SNES). Every spring, designers from around the world get to make up brand new games as if they’d been made for the Super Famicom, then see their work displayed on actual cartridges in METEOR’s gallery space. I was too busy to participate last year, but you better believe I’m locked and loaded for 2023 😎</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/roundups/famicase.png" alt="Two famicom cartidges with my own artwork.

Right: Dream Garden Duo, a pair of serene figures hold hands while their other hands levitate geometric flowers."> <figcaption>A couple of my past entries</figcaption> </figure> </li> <li class="tv"> <p>📺 <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shape-island/umc.cmc.40xdlw2jijoj95c3a6y2m3738" target="_blank"><em>Shape Island</em></a></strong></p> <p>I’ve long enjoyed the Jon Klassen’s books (<em>We Found a Hat</em> and <em>The Rock from the Sky</em> are favorites in our house), but I wasn’t as familiar with his Shape stories written with Mac Barnett. I’ll need to check them out now, since my kiddo has really been enjoying these charmingly stop-motion-animated shorts on AppleTV+.</p> </li> <li class="keyboard"> <p>⌨️ <strong><a href="https://parallel.limited/collections/gb-array" target="_blank">Array</a> by Parallel</strong></p> <p>I <a href="/words/roundup-001.html" target="_blank">wrote before</a> about the switches I put into my Tofu65 for coworking days, but it has now been usurped. Not the switches (which are great), but the board has been replaced with a beautiful, polycarbonate Parallel Array. Not only is it lighter in my backpack, it’s a stunner and easier to adjust on the fly thanks to the gummy O-ring mounting style.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/roundups/parallel-array.png" alt="Photo of a Parallel Array polycarbonate keyboard on a small, white deskpad.

		  <![CDATA[ <p>So I’ve already been doing this for a bit <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1560695614165422080?s=20&t=m9_0JNscIE9z0zs6AcZVcw" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, but I figured a longer form version with additional context could be fun. I don’t really have a regular cadence for this in mind — basically whenever I’ve experienced enough different things across various media that pique my interest.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>📖 <a href="https://simpletype.co/products/twenty-bits-websites" target="_blank"><em>Twenty Bits I Learned About Making Websites</em> by Dan Cederholm</a></h3> <p>I’ve been a Dan Fan™ for a long while, and have really enjoyed his previous releases in this series. There’s lots of fun little nuggets, but as he says <em>“This is not a book about code.”</em> More of a trip down memory lane to the early days of web standards with some timeless lessons.</p> </li> <li> <h3>🎵 <a href="https://orcd.co/pollen" target="_blank"><em>Pollen</em> by Tennis</a></h3> <p>Sure the album doesn’t come out ‘til February 10, but I still keep listening to the same 2 released tracks over and over. I keep 2020’s <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tennis-swimmer/" target="_blank">Swimmer</a></em> on regular rotation as-is, so I can’t wait to for new Tennis tunes to fill my ear holes.</p> </li> <li> <h3>📺 <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/willow/PfeL8yCNXD3r" target="_blank">Willow</a></h3> <p>I didn’t grow up with Ron Howard’s 1988 original flick <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/willow/" target="_blank">Willow</a></em>, but I caught it as an adult a few years ago and found it quite charming (doesn’t hurt that Warwick Davis is always a win). I was worried this series would play the usual “soft reboot, same cast 30+ years later, *wink wink nudge nudge* nostalgia card” that’s plagued so many IPs lately; but my wife and I have really enjoyed it! Has its own tone and frequently made us laugh out loud.</p> </li> <li> <h3>⌨️ Tofu65 with <a href="https://modedesigns.com/collections/switches/products/anthracite-silent-tactile-switches" target="_blank">Anthracite Silent Tactiles</a></h3> <p>The trusty ol’ Tofu was my first real mechanical keyboard, and it’s still the most portable one I own. Because of that, it’s also the one I take with me to <a href="https://workthefactory.com" target="_blank">The Factory</a> on coworking days. I’m not a heavy typer, but I’m always keeping my ears on a swivel for making too much noise in public spaces. Lo and behold my delight when <a href="https://modedesigns.com" target="_blank">Mode</a>, some of my favorite keyboard folks, released a silent tactile switch for quiet clackin’. They’re surprisingly good stock, and I haven’t heard any complaints from my desk neighbors.</p> </li> </ul> ]]>

	  	<![CDATA[ <p>Well hello there, new friend. This blog may not look like much yet, but I wanted to get a space set up sooner rather than later for my forthcoming thoughts. And while the paint may change, the bones will stay the same — so why not go ahead and move in?</p> <p>Some potential posts coming down the pipe:</p> <ul> <li><strong>“Job Awesome”</strong> (reflections on one year at <a href="https://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>)</li> <li><strong>“Fundamentals of Icon Design v2”</strong> (cleaning up writing, new visual examples, dropping the MetaLab project narrative framing)</li> <li><strong>“Clicksy Business”</strong> (getting into the mechanical keyboard hobby)</li> <li><strong>“We Got the Chunk”</strong> (the ups, downs, and more ups of making and maintaining <a href="http://chunkicons.com" target="_blank">Chunk icons</a>)</li> </ul> <p>Anything else you’d like to hear about? Gimme a hearty shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus" target="_blank">The Bird</a>, <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jabronus" target="_blank">The Elephant</a>, or good old <a href="mailto:noah@noahjacob.us?subject=Writing in the Open">electronic mail</a>.</p> ]]>
