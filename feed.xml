		  <![CDATA[ <p>Hi there! It’s been a bit.</p> <p>If I felt like last spring/summer was busy with speaking prep for <a href="https://noahjacob.us/words/config.html">Config 2023</a>, this one felt doubly so. Also I was holding off on posting because of (unsuccessfully) trying to redesign this place for the last 11 months. Anyway here are some things that happened since <a href="https://noahjacob.us/words/2023-favorites.html">the last time I wrote</a> in January:</p> <hr> <h2>Into the Awesomeverse</h2> <p>I helped launch and maintain our Kickstarter campaign for <a href="http://webawesome.com">Web Awesome</a> in the spring! I’d heard folks say that doing crowdfunding is way more work than you think it’s gonna be, and they weren’t kidding. Thankfully the Font/Web Awesome team is full of people much smarter than I am to help field questions and keep things compelling.</p> <p>In addition I got to design lots of swag, some of which only just reached the US. Physical products are no joke! Shouts out to the fine folks at <a href="http://cottonbureau.com">Cotton Bureau</a> for handling fulfillment and helping get things across the finish line. Keep an eye out for extras in our CB shop once all the backer rewards go out.</p> <figure><img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/2024-in-review/wa-deskpad.jpg" alt="Angled photo of an orange Web Awesome deskpad with a number of items arranged tastefully on its grid: yellow keycap puller, orange keyboard switch, Game Boy Advance, yellow calculator, 7-key macropad, and white USB-C power brick"> <figcaption>There’s a place for everything in Web Awesome</figcaption></figure> <p>In other Awesome news, we released all our remaining <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/introducing-sharp-duotone/">Sharp</a> and <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/duotone-icons-styles-upgrade/">Duotone</a> styles, and brought <a href="https://www.zachleat.com">Zach</a>/<a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> and <a href="https://lea.verou.me">Lea Verou</a> on board. A big year — with even more big things coming in 2025... 🤫</p> <hr> <h2>Chunk</h2> <p>I wrapped up version 3 of my <a href="http://chunkicons.com">Chunk</a> icon library! This was a big effort for li’l ol’ me — chipping away at an icon here and there after my kid went to sleep. Last year I’d pitched the improvements to Figma as part of their <a href="https://www.figma.com/community-creators/">Creator Grant</a> program and got accepted. Thankfully a concrete deadline for finishing the update wasn’t included in the contract, because it took me a few months longer than initially anticipated 😅 But along with completion came the chance to show off all my new pretties at <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-recap/">Config 2024</a> — so I popped into Keynote of all things and whipped up a short promotional video:</p> <div class="youtube"><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3VPJy6D9LI?si=PgmzsRPWvspgfKH4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <hr> <h2>Config</h2> <p>The Big Fig™ was a bit odd this year. Overcrowding, registration issues, and the overarching gloom of AI cruft cast a pall over the event. But the time, attention, sleepless nights, and love the Figma team put into every detail was also so readily apparent I really can’t fault anyone for the hiccups.</p> <p>A huge highlight for me, though, was the people — a recurring theme for this year in general. I got to spend some top drawer quality time with my internet bud <a href="http://alexdee.party">Alex</a> eating burritos and perusing the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/art-of-noise/"><em>Art of Noise</em></a> exhibit at SFMoMA. I also got to show off our <a href="https://modedesigns.com/products/dss-fontawesome-keycaps">Font Awesome keycaps</a> on a silver <a href="https://typface.com/pages/univers">Typface Univers</a> to anyone with a pulse and the slightest interest in computer input devices.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/2024-in-review/sanfran.jpg" alt="Three photos in a  triptych. Left to right: the crowd of Config attendees outisde Moscone right after closing, Teenage Engineering choir wooden figures all in a row at SFMoMa, and Alex Dee looking at books at the Art of Noise exhibit."></figure> <p>Issues aside, I’m planning on attending again in 2025 — if for no other reason than to get a burrito at <a href="https://www.garaje475.co">Garaje</a> and talk about video games and life goals with Alex again.</p> <hr> <h2>XOXO</h2> <p>It’s a weird time to be online.</p> <p>That was a recurring theme at the very last <a href="https://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a> festival — a place dedicated to the people who make things on the internet. And it was a theme I felt very keenly in a different way because it was my first and last time attending. I hadn’t even really been <em>aware</em> of XOXO until it had already been canceled in early 2020; but looking back through festival videos and first-hand accounts, I knew I had to get there if <a href="https://andymcmillan.com">Andy</a> &amp; <a href="https://waxy.org">Andy</a> ever did it again.</p> <p>By all accounts, this last hurrah was a stripped-back version of its former self: fewer days, fewer events, fewer musical guests. But that also meant it could be a more intimate and intentional space for those who’d come to call XOXO a second family.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/2024-in-review/xoxo.jpg" alt="Photo of a lit party tent in a field with twilit, overcast sky behind. Dozens of people are milling about chatting or sitting at nearby picnic tables."><figcaption>XOXO is dead, long live XOXO</figcaption></figure> <p>As the kids say, the vibes were immaculate. <small>(Do kids say that anymore?)</small> Even having never attended an XOXO before, I felt integrated immediately — no doubt helped by the general air of inclusion around the whole event. A sensible COVID policy? In <em>my</em> 2024? It’s more likely than you think.</p> <p><em>A few of my favorite talks:</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/Df_K7pIsfvg?si=Dh2OA-QFbuX23Acw">Cabel Sasser</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MTaeVVAvk-c?si=DSuBRIzFE7yG1aU5">Molly White</a>, Craig Mod, <a href="https://youtu.be/YzsMpWcLZbQ?si=S7Id__sXDZphVDds">Gita Jackson</a>, Sarah Jeong, <a href="https://youtu.be/WEFuGjmGq1I?si=i0WX9EXd0cKovN1E">Kim Belair</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FwM8HdOY-A?si=2XSX_EUyZ7ECppQ-">Erin Kissane</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/H2Mb-0QrYw0?si=ynQGXzkZKojPCw2C">Dan Olson</a>.</p> <p><em>And some of the lovely folks I got to spend time with (including friends new and old):</em> <a href="https://benkrogh.com">Ben Krogh</a>, <a href="https://arun.is">Arun Venkatesan</a>, <a href="https://www.antichrista.com">Christa Mrgan</a> (sorry I didn’t hear your karaoke), <a href="https://jezburrows.com">Jez Burrows</a>, <a href="https://www.nathanperetic.com">Nathan Peretic</a>, <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com">Lynn Fisher</a>, <a href="https://paulstraw.com">Paul Straw</a>, <a href="https://stublag.com">Paul Carroll</a>, <a href="https://bysusanlin.com">Susan Lin</a>, and <a href="https://fortunatehorse.com">Taylor Moore</a>.</p> <p>I wish I could drink that pear shrub again.</p> <div class="youtube"><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/App-7324TWQ?si=HMel2k5QcKOfZbyd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>  <hr> <h2>Creative Works East</h2> <p>While stranded in the airport en route to Config (and missing out on a dinner at <a href="https://www.thomaskeller.com/tfl">The French Laundry</a> 🥲), I got a message from Josh Horton asking me if I wanted to run an icon workshop at the upcoming <a href="https://www.creativeworks.co/east">Creative Works East</a> in Brooklyn. I’d always wanted to attend CW in the past but the timing never worked out with other travel commitments. So I said yes!</p> <figure><img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/2024-in-review/cw-title.jpg" alt="Title slide illustration from my Creative Works workshop: Building Cohesive Icons. On the left is an exploded view of a simple house icon with grid and keyshape layers behind."><figcaption>Every talk requires a stunning title slide</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve worked up lots of different icon education materials over the years in print and video form, but I’d never gotten to do a long, in-person workshop like this before. Not to mention those were free — so the added pressure of making it a good value for the people paying to hear <em>me talk about small pictures</em> was quite daunting.</p> <p>Unfortunately working on my presentation and materials every day for 3.5 months — overthinking and over-designing every single aspect — really stressed me out. I’m an absolute weirdo whose brain thinks that its first attempt at something new should be perfect. And giving myself a little slice of each day to worry about perfection and “giving people their money’s worth” really put my psyche through the wringer.</p> <figure><img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/2024-in-review/cweast.jpg" alt="Photo of me at a desk gesturing to the right while running a workshop. There are 3 attendees with laptops obscured in the foreground."><figcaption>This way to iconography best practices!</figcaption></figure> <p>But overall, it went well. I only had 4 registrants (conference attendance as a whole was low), but they were super engaged and asked fantastic questions. Having never run a 3-hour affair in the past, I ended up mistiming the pacing and had to rush through some bits to pack in as much info as I could. After a couple years of multiple speaking gigs, I’d like to lay low for a bit. But I <em>would</em> love to rework some of the Creative Works material into something more streamlined and useful in the future.</p> <p>Again, this one really ended up being about the people. Getting to spend more time with my buds <a href="https://www.danielseong.com">Daniel Seong</a>, Julia Steffen, <a href="https://rog.ie">Rogie King</a>, and <a href="https://www.helenazhang.com">Helena Zhang</a>; and getting to meet internet friends <a href="https://redhalftone.nyc">Lisa Champ</a>, <a href="https://ugmonk.com">Jeff Sheldon</a>, and <a href="https://kellianderson.com/">Kelli Anderson</a> for the first time.</p> <hr> <p>There’s more that could be said about each of these (and maybe I will), but I need to warm back up to this whole blogging thing. If there’s anything particular you’re curious about, let me know below with an electronic mail! ✌🏻</p> <hr> <p>💌 Find a mistake? Got something nice to say?

		  <![CDATA[ <p>Back in 2015 during my second read-through of Brandon Sanderson’s <em>Mistborn</em> trilogy, I got the itch to make my own little iconographic representations of the base Allomantic metals and their powers. My goal was to strip things down to some simple visual language:</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/allomancy.png" alt="8 goolden, geometric symbols I made to represent the main Allomantic metals from the Mistborn series: steel, iron, brass, zinc, pewter, tin, bronze, and copper."> </figure> <p>It was a fun and quick little project — and I didn’t think much about it until last year when Isaac Stewart, art director for Dragonsteel, reached out to me. Turns out they were looking for some nerdy folks to help design items for the Year of Sanderson swag boxes, and my name had resurfaced! Isaac already knew I loved Brandon’s books, and he’d gathered some of my previous work as reference for a specific project from the world of Sel: <em>bandages</em></p> <hr> <h2>Some background</h2> <p>The world of Sel is the home of <em>Elantris</em> and <em>The Emperor’s Soul</em> within Brandon’s literary Cosmere. I specifically don’t want to spoil much of the former, but it involves a decrepit city full of people who are doomed to accumulate minor injuries until they go mad. Fun!</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/style-reference.jpg" alt="An arrangement of vintage, paper and metallic packaging for various Johnson & Johnson Band-Aid products. If I had to guess, probably dating from the 1920s–1940s."> <figcaption>Reference image provided by Dragonsteel</figcaption> </figure> <p>We started with the above reference image and a brief:</p> <blockquote>Purpose/Tone: A bit of a spoof. In Elantris, Sarene brings items into the city to help the Elantrians inside who are suffering the Shaod. This box has band-aids intended to be used by Elantrians on their cuts that don’t heal.</blockquote> <p>With just these couple prompts, a template from the manufacturer, and some color ideas (also since it’d been a while, a quick re-read of parts of <em>Elantris</em>), we were off to the races.</p> <hr> <h2>Figuring it out</h2> <p>I dove into paper and pencil first. As usual, this was to get as many ideas (especially the bad ones) out of my brain as quickly as possible — but I don’t really have a consistent and organized way to handle these. Years of attending design conferences have left me with more little notebooks than I could ever use, so I just grab whatever’s handiest 😅</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/sketch-1.jpeg" alt="Me holding a little sketchbook filled with scrawlings of title ideas and tin layout."> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/sketch-3.jpeg" alt="Me holding a little sketchbook filled with scrawlings tin layout ideas."> </figure> <p>I took this step only as far as I needed to before starting to digitally rough out digital layouts — I work in Figma every day for my job at <a href="https://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> so I’m pretty speedy at this point, especially for such simple stuff. Eventually, 3 different directions and some guiding principles emerged:</p> <ul> <li>Spoofy portmanteau product names like: <em>Elant-Fix, Reo-lief, “Sarene’s Own” brand, Widow’s Trial Bandages</em></li> <li>Prominent use of Aon Rao</li> <li>Blues, browns, and golds</li> <li>“Product of Teod” stamped on the bottom</li> <li><em>“Eternal life of scrapes and bruises got you down in the dumps? Next time you slip on some slime, look no further than ____!”</em></li> <li>Small print disclaimers</li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/concept-1.png" alt="Rough Figma layout of the Cityscape concept broken into four panels. 1: Silhouette of Elantris cityscape and outer walls. 2: Prominent Aon Rao on blue strata inspired by vintage bandage tins. 3: Patterning along the bottom blue strip. 4: Testimontal blurb and/or disclaimer, also showing the different Aons featured on the bandages."> <figcaption>Layout concept 1: “Cityscape”</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/concept-2.png" alt="Rough Figma layout of the Text Block concept broken into four panels. 1: Pattern of Aons used on the bandages within. 2: Large text-based label reminiscent of reference materials.

There were some minor tweaks to make (like adjusting the name from <em>Elant-Fix</em> to <em>Elantri-Fix</em>), but the third concept clearly won. Even my written copy got to stick around!</p> <p>But I needed to start working on some of the fiddlier, ornamental bits — so back to the sketchbook I went:</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/sketch-2.jpeg" alt="Me holding a little sketchbook filled with scrawlings decorative corners and elements."> </figure> <p>The visuals for the borders and the big, central Aon Rao were first to settle, and helped inform probably my favorite bit to make: the title treatment.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/title.png" alt="The Elantri-Fix tin title treatment. Tall, serif letters surrounded by radiance lines and an interwoven border."> </figure> <p>For other non-title text, I turned to my favorite place to go type shopping: <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz" target="_blank">Future Fonts</a>. More specifically, the inherent strength and stylish flair in East of Rome’s excellent <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/east-of-rome/auroc" target="_blank">Auroc</a>.</p> <p>Thanks to planning everything in Figma, I was able to make the title lockup and all other reusable bits as component instances. Any changes I made to the main component would cascade through the entire layout and save me a bunch of time.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/components.png" alt="Figma screenshot showing the different component elements that I reused: borders for front, back, top, and side panels; title treatment explorations, and aons."> </figure> <p>Various components also came in handy when making the bandages themselves — all of the Aons could carry over, along with colors and some ornamental elements. So I really only had to a bandage component once, and could swap in the rest on the fly.</p> <hr> <h2>Making it real</h2> <p>As the deadline loomed for wrapping things up, I was in the midst of helping moving my parents across the country. So I didn’t have a ton of extra brain bandwidth to come up with a comprehensive recommendation, but I did offer the Dragonsteel team my thoughts on some fancy finishes and processes we could use during fabrication.</p> <p>Final designs were approved, files sent, and fees paid (the fastest turnaround I’ve seen)! <em>Then I waited for 10 months.</em> Manufacturing ain’t easy!</p> <p>The new year arrived, and I followed Brandon’s video updates on YouTube to hear any news of my precious li’l adhesive friends and their flip-top aluminum house. Then lo and behold, the YouTube unboxing videos began to appear!</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/youtube-unbox.png" alt="Screenshot of Jessie and Eric from the 17 Shard YouTube video where they open the Sel box. Eric is holding the tin I designed!"> <figcaption>Jessie and Eric from the <a href="https://youtu.be/UlmUlqAX7Mc?si=8q-kW2ob8t4VG_5M" target="_blank">17th Shard</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>I really can’t overstate how much all these videos warmed my heart. Everyone was very complementary and really seemed to love the cheeky tone and Easter eggs tucked throughout the designs.</p> <p>Both the tin and the bandages came out even better than I’d hoped! Isaac, the Dragonsteel team, and the manufacturer knocked my vision out of the park, and I couldn’t be happier with the result. They even gave me a few copies of my own to squirrel away or give to friends and family.</p> <p>And now, for some more pictures because I just enjoy looking at them 😄</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/store.png" alt="3/4 front and back profile photos of the tin from the Dragonsteel store product page"> <figcaption>Images from the Dragonsteel online store</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/mine.png" alt="A 3/4 profile and tin bottom photo I took in my home office"> <figcaption>Some quick shots I took in my office</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/elantri-fix/bandages.png" alt="Photo of my hand holing all the different colors of bandages, fanned out in an alluring display"> </figure> <hr> <p>💌 Find a mistake?

His previous graphic novel <em><a href="https://shortbox.gumroad.com/l/PrAcf" target="_blank">Homunculus</a></em> is also excellent, and both of them made me cry!

		  <![CDATA[ <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year again, the <a href="https://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a>!</p> <p>I mentioned this briefly in the <a href="https://noahjacob.us/words/roundup-002.html" target="_blank">last Enjoyment Roundup</a>; but for more context, My Famicase is a little show put on every spring by Satoshi Sakagami of <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> gallery in Nishi-Ogikubo, Tokyo. Every year, folks from all over the world get to design brand new, imaginary games for the Super Famicom system (Japan’s version of the Super Nintendo) and have them displayed on physical cartridges for all to see! I’ve had the honor of participating in 3 previous exhibitions, but took last year off due to having zero extra creativity.</p> <figure><img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/dream-garden.png" alt="A fictitious Famicom cartridges on a black background. Title: Dream Garden Duo. Illustration of a futuristic couple holding hands and plants with scifi halos around their serene expressions."> <figcaption>A favorite past entry, <em><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/11226741-Dream-Garden-Duo-Famicase-2020" target="_blank">Dream Garden Duo</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/gelatinous-cubicle.png" alt="A fictitious Famicom cartridges on a black background. Title: Gelatinous Cubicle. A skeleton, desk, chair, computer, and papers float freely inside a green, glowing mass."> <figcaption>And another, <em><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/15561014-Gelatinous-Cubicle-Famicase-2021" target="_blank">Gelatinous Cubicle: Dungeon Bureaucracy Simulator</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/onus.png" alt="A triangle, semi-occult-ish logo with an a drowsy eye in the center. It’s got a shiny, holographic sticker look to it."> <figcaption>The logo for ONUS, my fictitious game developer</figcaption> </figure> <hr> <h2>A sweet & sticky space mystery</h2> <p>As with most of my previous entries, the idea for the name came first. I have a note on my phone where I workshop Famicase ideas throughout the year so that once I realize <em>“oh dang I better get started”</em> in February or so, I can get started without too much stress. <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em> (2021’s entry) was born from this list, and I’m excited about some promising candidates for forthcoming years 😎</p> <p><em>S’MARS</em> quickly rose to the top this time, but I needed to figure out <em>what it meant.</em> Would it be about a planet made of gooey, burned confectionary? Maybe some sort of saccharine puzzle game? Thankfully, a rewatch of <em>Sunshine</em> and a YouTube playthrough of the <em>Dead Space</em> remake coincided to give the idea some loose structure.</p> <p>As always, things start with some rough sketches. I typically do this only as long as it takes me to scratch out a few ideas or type lockups that I like.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/famicase-sketch.jpeg" alt="Two pages of a small, pocket-sized sketchbook filled with S’MARS doodles. Left: s’more schematic and general notes to myself. Right: title treatment ideas."> <figcaption>The messier, the better</figcaption> </figure> <h2>There’s something hungry out there...</h2> <p>I knew I wanted to do something with a sci-fi technical schematic look, with text overlaid using some sort of transparency or blending mode. I made the ship first, but it was a bit too complicated at first to have text reliably and legibly sit on top. But after 5 iterations or so, I hit a general layout and color scheme (inspired by NASA, ofc) that worked well.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/old-ship.png" alt="Black and grey vector line drawing of the s’more ship. It has a quasi-isometric side perspective, and too many solar panels and other details."> <figcaption>An initial pass at the ship</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/old-type.png" alt="Two vertically stacked, unfinished type examples for the game art. Top is very NASA-y, though only smells MAR at this stage. The bottom is a much more angular and rigid take, though abandoned after MA and some light grey spacing blocks."> <figcaption>Early type explorations</figcaption> </figure> <p>I remade and recolored my old Famicom cartridge vector template in Figma, and <em>voila!</em></p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/cartridge.png" alt="Off-white Famicom cartridge with navy blue, sky blue, and red art. The word S’MARS is overlaid atop a lined schematic drawing of a spaceship made of multiple modules and panel arrays arrange along a central axis. It seems reminiscent of marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers?"> </figure> <p>The final title treatment, especially, was a blast to develop. I knew I wanted something tech-y and somewhat interconnected, but earlier NASA-esque explorations didn’t pan out the way I wanted. Plus, the juxtaposition of such stark and rigid lettering and an ooey-gooey treat is kind of funny.</p> <figure> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/famicase-2023/final-type.png" alt="The tech-y, sci-fi title treatment I made for S’MARS — centered in solid white with outlined yellow versions radiating vertically off of it."> <figcaption>Thank you, have a nice day!</figcaption> </figure> <p>With Famicase entries, though, the art is only half of it. You’re also encouraged to write a short game description that will go onto the website and exhibition booklet. It could be anything, which is intimidating! But some of my aforementioned media consumption helped crystallize into this:</p> <blockquote><em>Mallow Core: offline. Graham Panel Array: unresponsive. Choc Strut Integrity: compromised. We’re 84 million miles from home, and there’s something hungry out there.</em></blockquote> <hr> <p>I could keep writing about this stuff for a while, but honestly I didn't document as much of the process or rejected concepts as I’d hoped 😅 If you’d like to read more sometime about these (like using extensive Figma components for the first time while making <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em>) or anything else Famicase-related, hit that email link below.</p> <p>💌 Find a mistake?

		  <![CDATA[ <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/job-awesome/fa-emboss.png" alt="embossed version of the Font Awesome flag logo on a gritty, purple-navy background"> <p>One year ago today, I started working at <a href="http://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>. I’d already been planning on writing a bit about the experience and how it’s been different; but last month, Lynn Fisher posted an <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/unordered-incomplete-list-of-things-i-want-from-a-job/" target="_blank">excellent list of things she wants from a job</a>. The earnestness of her words helped clarify my own thoughts and put some things in perspective.</p> <p>But first, a little background. I used to work remote at a Canadian design agency. In the last couple years out of my 7 working there, I regularly kept an ear to the ground about new opportunities. Judging by LinkedIn and <a href="https://read.cv/jabronus" target="_blank">read.cv</a> profiles, 7 years is an <em>eternity</em> in tech — so I suppose it makes sense that things started to stagnate. I had a terrific manager, but the company didn’t really know what to do with me as one of the only design specialists. Very much a “the clients love you and we value what you do” but also a “we forgot to promote you for the things you were already doing” situation. Anyway, I was tired of it. And thanks to Lynn’s list, it’s much easier now to identify some key things I felt were missing:</p> <ul> <li><strong><s>Work that benefits the people who receive it.</s></strong> Benefit is hard to gauge with super quick, 2-week engagements. You do your best, explain your work’s worth and how it fits into the larger project, and cross your fingers and toes that it’ll get used correctly (or at all).</li> <li><strong><s>A team small enough to know everyone personally.</s></strong> By the time I left, we were well over 100 spread across multiple departments and countries around the world. Upside: lots of diverse clientele & coworker experiences. Downside: it was impossible to know everyone, much less work with them. Kind of a rough deal in terms of remote working relationships. Plus, the specialist “team” was so siloed and haggard we couldn’t actually get together and plan how to address issues we all faced.</li> <li><strong><s>The autonomy to make small and big decisions about my work.</s></strong></li> <li><strong><s>The ability and opportunity to share my work publicly.</s></strong> NDAs blow.</li> <li><strong><s>Very few meetings, used effectively.</s></strong></li> <li><strong><s>Work that makes me come alive.</s></strong> Aside from all the rest, one of the final nails in the coffin was the company’s growing involvement in web3 and crypto client projects. I voiced my concerns about <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com" target="_blank">that whole disaster</a> multiple times but was still assigned to them anyway.</li> </ul> <hr> <img src="https://noahjacob.us/images/blog/job-awesome/fa-playdate.png" alt="illustrated Font Awesome icon of a Pldaydate handheld console on a purple background. It’s positioned at a januty angle, and has a pixelated version of the Font Awseome logo on its black-and-white-screen."> <p>So one year in, has Font Awesome been different?</p> <p><em>A lot.</em></p> <p>We follow the tenets of <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup" target="_blank">Shape Up</a>, writing pitches and breaking work into digestible, 6-week chunks called “splits.” And in between these splits, we have 2-week cooldowns to work on fun things, fix random bugs, or learn new skills! A far cry from the blistering pace of agency client work. Let’s revisit some of that list:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Work that benefits the people who receive it.</strong> Everything at FA is based around icons, their implementation, and what our users and subscribers need — so I don’t need to constantly “sell” my skills or convince stakeholders that I belong at the table. Refreshing! Also being able to really dig in on something and tinker and revise until it works beats the heck out of fortnightly context whiplash.</li> <li><strong>A team small enough to know everyone personally.</strong> As of this writing, there are 18 of us. Even with everyone working remote, it's soooo much easier to build relationships when you can remember everyone's name. Plus we all <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/healthy-remote-work/" target="_blank">hang out</a> twice a year to noodle on new ideas, play D&D, and eat cookies.</li> <li><strong>The autonomy to make small and big decisions about my work.</strong> Everybody gets to have a say in what they work on. Pitches are written prior to each split outlining the planned work ahead and any foreseen potential pitfalls, and folks are welcome to help shape that direction and help hammer the scope down into something manageable.</li> <li><strong>The ability and opportunity to share my work publicly.</strong> I love talking about icons! I’ve done a fair share of written and video content about them in the past, and now I get to <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/add-some-class-with-font-awesome-sharp-icons/" target="_blank">keep</a> <a href="https://www.podcastawesome.com/2092855/12227182-nerd-show-and-tell-meet-noah-jacobus-senior-icon-designer" target="_blank">doing</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jabronus/109988072794511653" target="_blank">it</a>.</li> <li><strong>Very few meetings, used effectively </strong> I have about one meeting a week — that’s it. And it’s a pretty chill roundup of how everyone’s week has been.</li> <li><strong>Work that makes me come alive.</strong> I won’t go all Dani Rojas and say that “icons are life,” but I will say that working at Font Awesome has allowed all the parts of myself outside the 9–5 to more fully come alive. I haven’t had the Sunday Scaries once this past year. I’ve had spare creativity to use for freelance and side projects (like this blog!). Lower anxiety levels means better quality time with my family.</li> </ul> <p>Something our CEO Dave likes to talk a lot about is “work as a means to an end.” While it’s great to enjoy what you do for a living (and I’m incredibly blessed that I do), it should be just that: <em>for living.</em> Jobs should be tools to enable you to live the life you want when you’re not on the clock. (P.S. <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/hiring-a-product-designer/" target="_blank">We’re hiring!</a>)</p> <p>Cheers to one year and here’s to many awesome more ⚑</p> <hr> <aside>Thanks to Em for proofreading</aside> <p>💌 Find a mistake?

		  <![CDATA[ <p>More things have been enjoyed! I’ve also been tinkering with some style updates to the site and blog, but they’re not ready for primetime quite yet. I’d thought my design was pretty settled for a while, but as always <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/" target="_blank">Marcotte’s Law</a> holds true.</p> <ul class="roundup"> <li class="book"> <p>📖 <strong><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=The-Politics-of-Design" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Design</em></a> by Ruben Pater</strong></p> <blockquote>You are privileged.

		  <![CDATA[ <p>So I’ve already been doing this for a bit <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1560695614165422080?s=20&t=m9_0JNscIE9z0zs6AcZVcw" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, but I figured a longer form version with additional context could be fun. I don’t really have a regular cadence for this in mind — basically whenever I’ve experienced enough different things across various media that pique my interest.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>📖 <a href="https://simpletype.co/products/twenty-bits-websites" target="_blank"><em>Twenty Bits I Learned About Making Websites</em> by Dan Cederholm</a></h3> <p>I’ve been a Dan Fan™ for a long while, and have really enjoyed his previous releases in this series. There’s lots of fun little nuggets, but as he says <em>“This is not a book about code.”</em> More of a trip down memory lane to the early days of web standards with some timeless lessons.</p> </li> <li> <h3>🎵 <a href="https://orcd.co/pollen" target="_blank"><em>Pollen</em> by Tennis</a></h3> <p>Sure the album doesn’t come out ‘til February 10, but I still keep listening to the same 2 released tracks over and over. I keep 2020’s <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tennis-swimmer/" target="_blank">Swimmer</a></em> on regular rotation as-is, so I can’t wait to for new Tennis tunes to fill my ear holes.</p> </li> <li> <h3>📺 <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/willow/PfeL8yCNXD3r" target="_blank">Willow</a></h3> <p>I didn’t grow up with Ron Howard’s 1988 original flick <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/willow/" target="_blank">Willow</a></em>, but I caught it as an adult a few years ago and found it quite charming (doesn’t hurt that Warwick Davis is always a win). I was worried this series would play the usual “soft reboot, same cast 30+ years later, *wink wink nudge nudge* nostalgia card” that’s plagued so many IPs lately; but my wife and I have really enjoyed it! Has its own tone and frequently made us laugh out loud.</p> </li> <li> <h3>⌨️ Tofu65 with <a href="https://modedesigns.com/collections/switches/products/anthracite-silent-tactile-switches" target="_blank">Anthracite Silent Tactiles</a></h3> <p>The trusty ol’ Tofu was my first real mechanical keyboard, and it’s still the most portable one I own. Because of that, it’s also the one I take with me to <a href="https://workthefactory.com" target="_blank">The Factory</a> on coworking days. I’m not a heavy typer, but I’m always keeping my ears on a swivel for making too much noise in public spaces. Lo and behold my delight when <a href="https://modedesigns.com" target="_blank">Mode</a>, some of my favorite keyboard folks, released a silent tactile switch for quiet clackin’. They’re surprisingly good stock, and I haven’t heard any complaints from my desk neighbors.</p> </li> </ul> ]]>

	  	<![CDATA[ <p>Well hello there, new friend. This blog may not look like much yet, but I wanted to get a space set up sooner rather than later for my forthcoming thoughts. And while the paint may change, the bones will stay the same — so why not go ahead and move in?</p> <p>Some potential posts coming down the pipe:</p> <ul> <li><strong>“Job Awesome”</strong> (reflections on one year at <a href="https://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>)</li> <li><strong>“Fundamentals of Icon Design v2”</strong> (cleaning up writing, new visual examples, dropping the MetaLab project narrative framing)</li> <li><strong>“Clicksy Business”</strong> (getting into the mechanical keyboard hobby)</li> <li><strong>“We Got the Chunk”</strong> (the ups, downs, and more ups of making and maintaining <a href="http://chunkicons.com" target="_blank">Chunk icons</a>)</li> </ul> <p>Anything else you’d like to hear about? Gimme a hearty shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus" target="_blank">The Bird</a>, <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jabronus" target="_blank">The Elephant</a>, or good old <a href="mailto:noah@noahjacob.us?subject=Writing in the Open">electronic mail</a>.</p> ]]>
