				<h2>The Idea</h2>

				<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the concept of community for a long time. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I was homeschooled, or that I&rsquo;m naturally heavily introverted—but genuine group interest and interaction has greatly fascinated me for a long time. And none more so than the love and support of small, creative groups.</p>
				<p>I see it like a family. Family members have different strengths or interests; but a common goal of creating a better environment and a better collective future binds them to their work and to each other.</p>
				<p>I see this stuff crop up all the time. Design conferences. Tech meetups. <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/" target="_blank">Creative Mornings</a>. The coworking boom. People want to make cool, meaningful stuff and do it with other people.</p>
				<h3>So why don&rsquo;t I see it in Lexington?</h3>
				<p>For sure, it&rsquo;s not for lack of creativity or rambunctious self-starters. Just take a look down the <a href="http://nolicdc.com/" target="_blank">North Lime</a> corridor to find the evidence of that. But the family&rsquo;s spread out. They keep in contact here and there, but they don&rsquo;t have a great way to communicate. Advise the like-minded. Be praised for their successes. Aided in their trials.</p>
				<p>Credit must be given to folks at <a href="http://www.liverylex.com/" target="_blank">The Livery</a>, <a href="http://acupofcommonwealth.com/" target="_blank">A Cup of Common Wealth</a>, and <a href="http://nolicdc.com/portfolio/thenightmarket/" target="_blank">The Night Market</a> for making leaps in the right direction on this front. But I think we can do better. I think we can do more.</p>
				
				<h2>The Response</h2>
				
				<p>Lexington could use an advocate—somebody in its corner shouting about all the great stuff that&rsquo;s being dreamt up and made here. And not in the sense of a tourism board luring in outside spectators (though not unwelcome), but by getting local makers and non-makers alike super juiced about participating in the city&rsquo;s advancement.</p>
				<p>People from all sorts of disciplines being informed of and celebrated by their community through a stellar web presence, workshops, lectures, interviews, tours, etc.</p>
				<p>All the bones are there. Made in Lex can be the muscles.</p>
				<h3>Purposes for Made in Lex:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>To spotlight local creatives &amp; businesses through periodical features/interviews/videos/long-form journalism</li>
					<li>To generate a dialogue for friendship and collaboration among local creatives, online and in person</li>
					<li>To give locals opportunities to meet, help, or patronize creative folks/institutions</li>
					<li>To showcase Lexington and all its creative strength on the interwebz</li>
				</ol>
					
				<h2>The Method</h2>
				
				<p>At its most basic level, I see this endeavor as a fusion of <a href="http://www.athensmade.com/" target="_blank">Athensmade</a> and <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/" target="_blank">The Great Discontent</a>. Made in Lex (or whatever clever name might be better) would not only be a branding resource or badge of pride, but also a shared stage to discover and celebrate Lexington&rsquo;s creative scene.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;d be swell to get some interviews, vids, and writing nailed down before any sort of launch. What would be the icing on the cake, though, would be physical meetups every month, dependably scheduled at various locations around town.</p>
