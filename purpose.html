				<h2>TL;DR:</h2>
				
				<ol>
					<li>To spotlight local creatives &amp; businesses through periodical features/interviews/videos/long-form journalism</li>
					<li>To generate a dialogue for friendship and collaboration among local creatives, online and in person</li>
					<li>To give locals opportunities to meet, help, or patronize creative folks/institutions</li>
					<li>To showcase Lexington and all its creative strength on the interwebz</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h2>The Idea</h2>

				<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the concept of community for a long time. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I was homeschooled, or that I&rsquo;m naturally heavily introverted&mdash;but genuine group interest and interaction has greatly fascinated me for a long time. And none more so than the love and support of small, creative groups.</p>
				<p>I see it like a family. Family members have different strengths or interests; but a common goal of creating a better environment and a better collective future binds them to their work and to each other.</p>
				<p>I see this stuff crop up all the time. Design conferences. Tech meetups. <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/" target="_blank">Creative Mornings</a>. The coworking boom. People want to make cool, meaningful stuff and do it with other people.</p>
				<h3>So why don&rsquo;t I see it in Lexington?</h3>
				<p>For sure, it&rsquo;s not for lack of creativity or rambunctious self-starters. Just take a look down the <a href="http://nolicdc.com/" target="_blank">North Lime</a> corridor to find the evidence of that. But the family&rsquo;s spread out. They keep in contact here and there, but they don&rsquo;t have a great way to communicate. Advise the like-minded. Be praised for their successes. Aided in their trials.</p>
				<p>Credit must be given to folks at <a href="http://www.liverylex.com/" target="_blank">The Livery</a>, <a href="http://acupofcommonwealth.com/" target="_blank">A Cup of Common Wealth</a>, and <a href="http://nolicdc.com/portfolio/thenightmarket/" target="_blank">The Night Market</a> for making leaps in the right direction on this front. But I think we can do better. I think we can do more.</p>
				
				<h2>The Response</h2>
				
				<p>Lexington could use an advocate&mdash;somebody in its corner shouting about all the great stuff that&rsquo;s being dreamt up and made here. And not in the sense of a tourism board luring in outside spectators (though not unwelcome), but by getting local makers and non-makers alike super juiced about participating in the city&rsquo;s advancement.</p>
				<p>People from all sorts of disciplines being informed of and celebrated by their community through a stellar web presence, workshops, lectures, interviews, tours, etc.</p>
				<p>All the bones are there. Made in Lex can be the muscles.</p>
