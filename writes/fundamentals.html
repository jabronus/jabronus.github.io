			<h1>The Fundamentals of Icon Design</h1>
			
			<p>Hi there! I’m Noah, longtime MetaLab blog reader, first-time writer. I started out in product design before carving out a niche for myself as the team's very first Design Specialist. I typically stick with iconography & illustration these days.</p>
			
			<p>Why am I talking about icons, exactly? Icons are like microcosms of a product or a brand. Through what they depict and how they depict it, you can glean a lot about a product, how it functions, and how interacting with it might make you feel.</p>
			
			<p><em>So, what is an icon?</em></p>
			
			<p>There’s a lot of interpretations of the word icon floating out there in the design world, but the most helpful for our purposes comes from illustrator extraordinaire <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/product-vs-marketing-illustration-7ac474dfe2ed?gi=1e4a2ebc1aa4" target="_blank">Meg Robichaud</a>:</p>
			
			<blockquote>An icon is a symbol … representing a larger idea. It’s one of those things that you shouldn’t notice when it’s done really well, but always notice when it’s done poorly (which is a lot of the time). Above all else, an icon should be something you can easily interact with. It should be intuitive. It should concisely capture the idea that it represents.</blockquote>
			
			<p>Of course, this can cover a lot of ground, so in the interest of time (and our considerable workloads) we’ll just be focusing on UI icons in a mobile product. But this is also where you can really let an app’s personality shine!</p>
			
			<p>And a fantastic opportunity to do just that arose earlier this year with <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/" target="_blank">Indigo</a>, a fast-growing startup that brings Silicon Valley tech into the world of agriculture. Their existing marketplace connects farmers and buyers, and we partnered with them to expand that experience to mobile.</p>
		
			<h2>Groundwork</h2>
		
			<h3>Why icons matter</h3>
		
			<p>So why isn’t more care given to icons? A lot of products treat them as an afterthought (if they're thought about at all), and sometimes don't change at all from wireframes through final deliverables. Now not every project calls for custom icon work. But relying on stock icons is the same as relying on stock photography; it might functionally do the job, but it’s generic, unownable, and doesn’t speak to a brand/product’s particular strengths and quirks. And we quickly learned that in the farming and agriculture space, well-made and cohesive icon sets are hard to come by.</p>
