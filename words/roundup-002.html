			<h1>Enjoyment Roundup 002</h1>
			
			<time datetime="2023-02-03">February 3, 2023</time>
		
			<p>More things have been enjoyed! I’ve also been tinkering with some style updates to the site and blog, but they’re not ready for primetime quite yet. I’d thought my design was pretty settled for a while, but as always <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/" target="_blank">Marcotte’s Law</a> holds true.</p>
			
			<ul class="roundup">
				<li class="book">
					<p class="roundup-title"><strong><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=The-Politics-of-Design" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Design</em></a> by Ruben Pater</strong></p>
					<p><em>“You are privileged. Just reading this sentence makes you part of the 85% of the world population that is literate, the 20% that understands English, and the 40% that has access to the internet.”</em></p>
					<p>I’m not quite all the way through yet, but it’s a both brisk and brusque read with a welcome tone. Adding Ruben’s <a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK" target="_blank"><em>Caps Lock</em></a> to my reading list next.
				</li>
				
				<li class="music">
					<p class="roundup-title"><strong><a href="https://boygenius.lnk.to/TheRecord/" target="_blank"><em>The Record</em></a> by boygenius</strong></p>
					<p>Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus are at it again. <em>No words, just listen.</em> Full album comes out March 31.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="website">
					<p class="roundup-title"><strong><a href="http://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a></strong></p>
					<p>The most wonderful time of the year is coming soon! Hosted by <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> in Nishiogikubo, My Famicase is a celebration of the Super Famicom game system (Japan’s version of the Nintendo SNES). Every spring, designers from around the world get to make up brand new games as if they’d been made for the Super Famicom, then see their work displayed on actual cartridges in METEOR’s gallery space. I was too busy to participate last year, but you better believe I’m locked and loaded for 2023 😎</p>

					<p class="roundup-title"><strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shape-island/umc.cmc.40xdlw2jijoj95c3a6y2m3738" target="_blank"><em>Shape Island</em></a></strong></p>
					<p>I’ve long enjoyed the Jon Klassen’s books (<em>We Found a Hat</em> and <em>The Rock from the Sky</em> are favorites in our house), but I wasn’t as familiar with his Shape stories written with Mac Barnett. I’ll need to check them out now, since my kiddo has really been enjoying these charmingly stop-motion-animated shorts on AppleTV+.</p>

					<p class="roundup-title"><strong><a href="https://parallel.limited/collections/gb-array" target="_blank">Array</a> by Parallel</strong></p>
					<p>I <a href="/words/roundup-001.html" target="_blank">wrote before</a> about the switches I put into my Tofu65 for coworking days, but it has now been usurped. Not the switches (which are great), but the board has been replaced with a beautiful, polycarbonate Parallel Array. Not only is it lighter in my backpack, it’s a stunner and easier to adjust on the fly thanks to the gummy O-ring mounting style.</p>
