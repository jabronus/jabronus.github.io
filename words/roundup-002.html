			<h1>Enjoyment Roundup 002</h1>
			
			<time datetime="2023-02-03">February 3, 2023</time>
		
			<p>More things have been enjoyed! Iâ€™ve also been tinkering with some style updates to the site and blog, but theyâ€™re not ready for primetime quite yet. Iâ€™d thought my design was pretty settled for a while, but as always <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/" target="_blank">Marcotteâ€™s Law</a> holds true.</p>
			
			<ul class="roundup">
				<li class="book">
					<p><strong><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=The-Politics-of-Design" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Design</em></a> by Ruben Pater</strong></p>
					<blockquote>You are privileged. Just reading this sentence makes you part of the 85% of the world population that is literate, the 20% that understands English, and the 40% that has access to the internet.</blockquote>
					<p>Iâ€™m not quite all the way through yet, but itâ€™s a both brisk and brusque read with a welcome tone. Adding Rubenâ€™s <a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK" target="_blank"><em>Caps Lock</em></a> to my reading list next.
				</li>
				
				<li class="music">
					<p><strong><a href="https://boygenius.lnk.to/TheRecord/" target="_blank"><em>The Record</em></a> by boygenius</strong></p>
					<p>Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus are at it again. <em>No words, just listen.</em> Full album comes out March 31.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="website">
					<p><strong><a href="http://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a></strong></p>
					<p>The most wonderful time of the year is coming soon! Hosted by <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> in Nishiogikubo, My Famicase is a celebration of the Super Famicom game system (Japanâ€™s version of the Nintendo SNES). Every spring, designers from around the world get to make up brand new games as if theyâ€™d been made for the Super Famicom, then see their work displayed on actual cartridges in METEORâ€™s gallery space. I was too busy to participate last year, but you better believe Iâ€™m locked and loaded for 2023 ðŸ˜Ž</p>

					<p><strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shape-island/umc.cmc.40xdlw2jijoj95c3a6y2m3738" target="_blank"><em>Shape Island</em></a></strong></p>
					<p>Iâ€™ve long enjoyed the Jon Klassenâ€™s books (<em>We Found a Hat</em> and <em>The Rock from the Sky</em> are favorites in our house), but I wasnâ€™t as familiar with his Shape stories written with Mac Barnett. Iâ€™ll need to check them out now, since my kiddo has really been enjoying these charmingly stop-motion-animated shorts on AppleTV+.</p>

					<p><strong><a href="https://parallel.limited/collections/gb-array" target="_blank">Array</a> by Parallel</strong></p>
					<p>I <a href="/words/roundup-001.html" target="_blank">wrote before</a> about the switches I put into my Tofu65 for coworking days, but it has now been usurped. Not the switches (which are great), but the board has been replaced with a beautiful, polycarbonate Parallel Array. Not only is it lighter in my backpack, itâ€™s a stunner and easier to adjust on the fly thanks to the gummy O-ring mounting style.</p>
