			<h1>The Fundamentals of Icon Design</h1>
			
			<aside>This piece was originally published <a class="aside" href="https://www.metalab.com/blog/fundamentals-of-icon-design" target="_blank">on the MetaLab blog</a> on October 21, 2020. Thanks to the team there (especially Edy) for encouraging me to write it.</aside>

				<p>Hi there! I’m Noah, longtime MetaLab blog reader, first-time writer. I started out in product design before carving out a niche for myself as the team's very first Design Specialist. I typically stick with iconography & illustration these days.</p>
			
				<p>Why am I talking about icons, exactly? Icons are like microcosms of a product or a brand. Through what they depict and how they depict it, you can glean a lot about a product, how it functions, and how interacting with it might make you feel.</p>
			
				<p><em>So, what is an icon?</em></p>
			
				<p>There’s a lot of interpretations of the word icon floating out there in the design world, but the most helpful for our purposes comes from illustrator extraordinaire <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/product-vs-marketing-illustration-7ac474dfe2ed?gi=1e4a2ebc1aa4" target="_blank">Meg Robichaud</a>:</p>
			
				<blockquote>An icon is a symbol … representing a larger idea. It’s one of those things that you shouldn’t notice when it’s done really well, but always notice when it’s done poorly (which is a lot of the time). Above all else, an icon should be something you can easily interact with. It should be intuitive. It should concisely capture the idea that it represents.</blockquote>
			
				<p>Of course, this can cover a lot of ground, so in the interest of time (and our considerable workloads) we’ll just be focusing on UI icons in a mobile product. But this is also where you can really let an app’s personality shine!</p>
			
				<p>And a fantastic opportunity to do just that arose earlier this year with <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/" target="_blank">Indigo</a>, a fast-growing startup that brings Silicon Valley tech into the world of agriculture. Their existing marketplace connects farmers and buyers, and we partnered with them to expand that experience to mobile.</p>

				<h2>Groundwork</h2>
		
					<h3>Why icons matter</h3>
		
					<p>So why isn’t more care given to icons? A lot of products treat them as an afterthought (if they're thought about at all), and sometimes don't change at all from wireframes through final deliverables. Now not every project calls for custom icon work. But relying on stock icons is the same as relying on stock photography; it might functionally do the job, but it’s generic, unownable, and doesn’t speak to a brand/product’s particular strengths and quirks. And we quickly learned that in the farming and agriculture space, well-made and cohesive icon sets are hard to come by.</p>
			
					<p>If you're trying to sell the idea of custom iconography to a stakeholder, here are a few more concrete rationales you can provide:</p>
			
					<ul>
						<li>The set you have isn’t extensive enough or expandable (e.g. missing or inconsistent rules).</li>
						<li>The product is using uncommon or new visual metaphors. Maybe it’s workflow-heavy and has some tool functionality that hasn’t been represented before.</li>
						<li>There are some funky UI or typography choices that should be paired & reflected in the iconography.</li>
					</ul>
				
					<h3>Strategy and tone</h3>

					</figure>
				
					<p>Laying out a baseline strategy with Indigo and our internal project team was vital to hitting the ground running. The sooner you can develop a shared language of what you’re trying to say and how to say it, the fewer frustrations you’ll run into later.</p>
				
					<p>A big part of our attack plan when we’re starting an icon work is performing a comprehensive audit. An audit is the process of going through the product to figure out what it needs, and identifying potential areas where icon or illustration could elevate the experience.</p>
				
					<p>In a couple days, we figured out an itemized list of every icon/illustration opportunity. Each entry included the existing icon location, function within the UI, metaphor/style notes, target resolution(s), priority, and other considerations (like active states).</p>
				
					<h3>Visual metaphors</h3>
				
					<p>Once we knew what we were dealing with, we set to task figuring out how to make this product stand out—how might we design iconography that not only differentiates Indigo but also supports its users?</p>
				
					<p>For inspiration, let’s look at a couple good examples of thoughtful & specific approaches in their respective spaces: Twitter (though Twitterrific did it better first) and Spotify:</p>
				
					<figure>

					<p>Twitter puts a fun spin on the ubiquitous home icon by rendering it as a jaunty birdhouse. And through the use of just three simple lines, Spotify suggests the old cubby shelves in your parents’ basement full of vinyl records.</p>
				
					<p>For Indigo, various farming imagery naturally came to the forefront, but we limited it to some high impact areas like tab bars and onboarding. The users know what they’re doing—they don't need hay bales and irrigation equipment shoved in their faces from all quarters.</p>
				
					<p>Figuring out metaphors can be an ongoing process, and usually dovetails (if not entirely overlaps) with ideation. Everybody’s got their own way to muddle through this;  when I’m starting a set from scratch, I try to draw as much as I can on paper to get my thoughts out.</p>
				
					<figure>
						<img class="placeholder">
						<figcaption>Trying to figure out general level of detail. Nothing fancy here...</figcaption>
					</figure>
				
					<p>Your mileage may vary with this, of course. Sometimes, I dive right into the computer if the style is already pretty well-established or I’m expanding an existing set that already has rules.</p>
				
					<figure>
						<img class="placeholder">
						<figcaption>Don't try to nail anything on the first attempt. Sketching is just to get your ideas out of your brain as quickly as possible.</figcaption>

				<h2>Style</h2>
				
					<blockquote>The start of any design project is overwhelming, and finding restrictions to impose on yourself can focus your attention and lead to more creative solutions. By considering an icon’s context, you’re immediately able to tick off a number of decisions and direct your focus accordingly.</blockquote>
					
					‍<p><a href="https://medium.com/@lunarsaloon/on-icon-design-c6f92b474c5f" target="_blank">Alex Griendling is right</a>. One of the things I hear most often about icon design is “That sounds miserable. There’s so little space!” And while the second half of that sentiment is true, embracing the inherent constraints can simultaneously do a lot of work for you, and free up your mind for new ideas.</p>
					
					<p>Imposing limitations on yourself is one of the most valuable things you can do in icon design (or most design, for that matter). Not only will it save a lot of headaches down the road if you understand and plan for them, but it allows creativity to flourish once you've narrowed your scope.</p>
					
					<p>Beginning with a set of aesthetic rules is a great place to start—so, on Indigo, we did.</p>
					
					<h3>Grid</h3>
					
					<p>The skeleton of every icon set is its underlying grid system. You’re probably aware of <a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline" target="_blank">Google’s Material Icons</a>, which are built on a 24x24 pixel grid. But other multiples of 8 are pretty common, from 8x8 up to 64x64 or more (though that often infringes on spot illustration territory).</p>
