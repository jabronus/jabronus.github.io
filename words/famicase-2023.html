		<p>It‚Äôs the most wonderful time of the year again, the <a href="https://famicase.com" target="_blank">My Famicase Exhibition</a>!</p>
		
		<p>I mentioned this briefly in the <a href="https://noahjacob.us/words/roundup-002.html" target="_blank">last Enjoyment Roundup</a>; but for more context, My Famicase is a little show put on every spring by Satoshi Sakagami of <a href="https://super-meteor.com" target="_blank">METEOR</a> gallery in Nishi-Ogikubo, Tokyo. Every year, folks from all over the world get to design brand new, imaginary games for the Super Famicom system (Japan‚Äôs version of the Super Nintendo) and have them displayed on physical cartridges for all to see! I‚Äôve had the honor of participating in 3 previous exhibitions, but took last year off due to having zero extra creativity.</p>

		<h2>A sweet & sticky space mystery</h2>
		
		<p>As with most of my previous entries, the idea for the name came first. I have a note on my phone where I workshop Famicase ideas throughout the year so that once I realize <em>‚Äúoh dang I better get started‚Äù</em> in February or so, I can get started without too much stress. <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em> (2021‚Äôs entry) was born from this list, and I‚Äôm excited about some promising candidates for forthcoming years üòé</p>
		
		<p><em>S‚ÄôMARS</em> quickly rose to the top this time, but I needed to figure out <em>what it meant.</em> Would it be about a planet made of gooey, burned confectionary? Maybe some sort of saccharine puzzle game? Thankfully, a rewatch of <em>Sunshine</em> and a YouTube playthrough of the <em>Dead Space</em> remake coincided to give the idea some loose structure.</p>
		
		<p>As always, things start with some rough sketches. I typically do this only as long as it takes me to scratch out a few ideas or type lockups that I like.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/blog/famicase-2023/famicase-sketch.jpeg" alt="Two pages of a small, pocket-sized sketchbook filled with S‚ÄôMARS doodles. Left: s‚Äômore schematic and general notes to myself. Right: title treatment ideas.">

		<h2>There‚Äôs something hungry out there...</h2>
		
		<p>I knew I wanted to do something with a sci-fi technical schematic look, with text overlaid using some sort of transparency or blending mode. I made the ship first, but it was a bit too complicated at first to have text reliably and legibly sit on top. But after 5 iterations or so, I hit a general layout and color scheme (inspired by NASA, ofc) that worked well.</p>

		<p>I remade and recolored my old Famicom cartridge vector template in Figma, and <em>voila!</em></p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/blog/famicase-2023/cartridge.png" alt="Off-white Famicom cartridge with navy blue, sky blue, and red art. The word S‚ÄôMARS is overlaid atop a lined schematic drawing of a spaceship made of multiple modules and panel arrays arrange along a central axis. It seems reminiscent of marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers?">
		</figure>
		
		<p>The final title treatment, especially, was a blast to develop. I knew I wanted something tech-y and somewhat interconnected, but earlier NASA-esque explorations didn‚Äôt pan out the way I wanted. Plus, the juxtaposition of such stark and rigid lettering and an ooey-gooey treat is kind of funny.</p>

		<p>With Famicase entries, though, the art is only half of it. You‚Äôre also encouraged to write a short game description that will go onto the website and exhibition booklet. It could be anything, which is intimidating! But some of my aforementioned media consumption helped crystallize into this:</p>
		
		<blockquote><em>Mallow Core: offline. Graham Panel Array: unresponsive. Choc Strut Integrity: compromised. We‚Äôre 84 million miles from home, and there‚Äôs something hungry out there.</em></blockquote>

		<p>I could keep writing about this stuff for a while, but honestly I didn't document as much of the process or rejected concepts as I‚Äôd hoped üòÖ If you‚Äôd like to read more sometime about these (like using extensive Figma components for the first time while making <em>Gelatinous Cubicle</em>) or anything else Famicase-related, hit that email link below.</p>
