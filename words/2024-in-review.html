		<h1>2024 in Review</h1>
		
		<time datetime="2024-12-24">December 24, 2024</time>
		
		<p>Hi there! It’s been a bit.</p>
		
		<p>If I felt like last spring/summer was busy with speaking prep for <a href="/words/config.html">Config 2023</a>, this one felt doubly so. Also I was holding off on posting because of (unsuccessfully) trying to redesign this place for the last 11 months. Anyway here are some things that happened since <a href="/words/2023-favorites.html">the last time I wrote</a> in January:</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2>Into the Awesomeverse</h2>
		
		<p>I helped launch and maintain our Kickstarter campaign for <a href="http://webawesome.com">Web Awesome</a> in the spring! I’d heard folks say that doing crowdfunding is way more work than you think it’s gonna be, and they weren’t kidding. Thankfully the Font/Web Awesome team is full of people much smarter than I am to help field questions and keep things compelling.</p>
		
		<p>In addition I got to design lots of swag, some of which only just reached the US. Physical products are no joke! Shouts out to the fine folks at <a href="http://cottonbureau.com">Cotton Bureau</a> for handling fulfillment and helping get things across the finish line. Keep an eye out for extras in our CB shop once all the backer rewards go out.</p>

			<figcaption>There’s a place for everything in Web Awesome</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In other Awesome news, we released all our remaining <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/introducing-sharp-duotone/">Sharp</a> and <a href="https://blog.fontawesome.com/duotone-icons-styles-upgrade/">Duotone</a> styles, and brought <a href="https://www.zachleat.com">Zach</a>/<a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> and <a href="https://lea.verou.me">Lea Verou</a> on board. A big year — with even more big things coming in 2025... 🤫</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2>Chunk</h2>
		
		<p>I wrapped up version 3 of my <a href="http://chunkicons.com">Chunk</a> icon library! This was a big effort for li’l ol’ me — chipping away at an icon here and there after my kid went to sleep. Last year I’d pitched the improvements to Figma as part of their <a href="https://www.figma.com/community-creators/">Creator Grant</a> program and got accepted. Thankfully a concrete deadline for finishing the update wasn’t included in the contract, because it took me a few months longer than initially anticipated 😅 But along with completion came the chance to show off all my new pretties at <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-recap/">Config 2024</a> — so I popped into Keynote of all things and whipped up a short promotional video:</p>

		<hr>
		
		<h2>Config</h2>
		
		<p>The Big Fig™ was a bit odd this year. Overcrowding, registration issues, and the overarching gloom of AI cruft cast a pall over the event. But the time, attention, sleepless nights, and love the Figma team put into every detail was also so readily apparent I really can’t fault anyone for the hiccups.</p>
		
		<p>A huge highlight for me, though, was the people — a recurring theme for this year in general. I got to spend some top drawer quality time with my internet bud <a href="http://alexdee.party">Alex</a> eating burritos and perusing the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/art-of-noise/"><em>Art of Noise</em></a> exhibit at SFMoMA. I also got to show off our <a href="https://modedesigns.com/products/dss-fontawesome-keycaps">Font Awesome keycaps</a> on a silver <a href="https://typface.com/pages/univers">Typface Univers</a> to anyone with a pulse and the slightest interest in computer input devices.</p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>Issues aside, I’m planning on attending again in 2025 — if for no other reason than to get a burrito at <a href="https://www.garaje475.co">Garaje</a> and talk about video games and life goals with Alex again.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2>XOXO</h2>
		
		<p>It’s a weird time to be online.</p>
		
		<p>That was a recurring theme at the very last <a href="https://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a> festival — a place dedicated to the people who make things on the internet. And it was a theme I felt very keenly in a different way because it was my first and last time attending. I hadn’t even really been <em>aware</em> of XOXO until it had already been canceled; but looking back through festival videos and first-hand accounts, I knew I had to get there if <a href="https://andymcmillan.com">Andy</a> &amp; <a href="https://waxy.org">Andy</a> ever did it again.</p>
		
		<p>By all accounts, this last hurrah was a stripped-back version of its former self: fewer days, fewer events, fewer musical guests. But that also meant it could be a more intimate and intentional space for those who’d come to call XOXO a second family.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/blog/2024-in-review/xoxo.jpg" alt="Photo of a lit party tent in a field with twilit, overcast sky behind. Dozens of people are milling about chatting or sitting at nearby picnic tables.">

		</figure>
		
		<p>As the kids say, the vibes were immaculate. <small>(Do kids say that anymore?)</small> Even having never attended an XOXO before, I felt integrated immediately — no doubt helped by the general air of inclusion around the whole event. A sensible COVID policy? In <em>my</em> 2024? It’s more likely than you think.</p>
		
		<p><em>A few of my favorite talks:</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/Df_K7pIsfvg?si=Dh2OA-QFbuX23Acw">Cabel Sasser</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MTaeVVAvk-c?si=DSuBRIzFE7yG1aU5">Molly White</a>, Craig Mod, <a href="https://youtu.be/YzsMpWcLZbQ?si=S7Id__sXDZphVDds">Gita Jackson</a>, Sarah Jeong, <a href="https://youtu.be/WEFuGjmGq1I?si=i0WX9EXd0cKovN1E">Kim Belair</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FwM8HdOY-A?si=2XSX_EUyZ7ECppQ-">Erin Kissane</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/H2Mb-0QrYw0?si=ynQGXzkZKojPCw2C">Dan Olson</a>.</p>
		
		<p><em>And some of the lovely folks I got to spend time with (including friends new and old):</em> <a href="https://benkrogh.com">Ben Krogh</a>, <a href="https://arun.is">Arun Venkatesan</a>, <a href="https://www.antichrista.com">Christa Mrgan</a> (sorry I didn’t hear your karaoke), <a href="https://jezburrows.com">Jez Burrows</a>, <a href="https://www.nathanperetic.com">Nathan Peretic</a>, <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com">Lynn Fisher</a>, <a href="https://paulstraw.com">Paul Straw</a>, <a href="https://stublag.com">Paul Carroll</a>, <a href="https://bysusanlin.com">Susan Lin</a>, and <a href="https://fortunatehorse.com">Taylor Moore</a>.</p>
		
		<p>I wish I could drink that pear shrub again.</p>

		<h2>Creative Works East</h2>
		
		<p>While stranded in the airport en route to Config (and missing out on a dinner at <a href="https://www.thomaskeller.com/tfl">The French Laundry</a> 🥲), I got a message from Josh Horton asking me if I wanted to run an icon workshop at the upcoming <a href="https://www.creativeworks.co/east">Creative Works East</a> in Brooklyn. I’d always wanted to attend CW in the past but the timing never worked out with other travel commitments. So I said yes!</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/blog/2024-in-review/cw-title.jpg" alt="Title slide illustration from my Creative Works workshop: Building Cohesive Icons. On the left is an exploded view of a simple house icon with grid and keyshape layers behind.">
			<figcaption>Every talk requires a stunning title slide</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>I’ve worked up lots of different icon education materials over the years in print and video form, but I’d never gotten to do a long, in-person workshop like this before. Not to mention those were free — so the added pressure of making it a good value for the people paying to hear <em>me talk about small pictures</em> was quite daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately working on my presentation and materials every day for 3.5 months — overthinking and over-designing every single aspect — really stressed me out. I’m an absolute weirdo whose brain thinks that its first attempt at something new should be perfect. And giving myself a little slice of each day to worry about perfection and “giving people their money’s worth” really put my psyche through the wringer.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/blog/2024-in-review/cweast.jpg" alt="Photo of me at a desk gesturing to the right while running a workshop. There are 3 attendees with laptops obscured in the foreground.">
			<figcaption>This way to iconography best practices!</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>But overall, it went well. I only had 4 registrants (conference attendance as a whole was low), but they were super engaged and asked fantastic questions. Having never run a 3-hour affair in the past, I ended up mistiming the pacing and had to rush through some bits to pack in as much info as I could. After a couple years of multiple speaking gigs, I’d like to lay low for a bit. But I <em>would</em> love to rework some of the Creative Works material into something more streamlined and useful in the future.</p>
		
		<p>Again, this one really ended up being about the people. Getting to spend more time with my buds <a href="https://www.danielseong.com">Daniel Seong</a>, Julia Steffen, <a href="https://rog.ie">Rogie King</a>, and <a href="https://www.helenazhang.com">Helena Zhang</a>; and getting to meet internet friends <a href="https://redhalftone.nyc">Lisa Champ</a>, <a href="https://ugmonk.com">Jeff Sheldon</a>, and <a href="https://kellianderson.com/">Kelli Anderson</a> for the first time.</p>

		<p>There’s more that could be said about each of these (and maybe I will), but I need to warm back up to this whole blogging thing. If there’s anything particular you’re curious about, let me know below with an electronic mail! ✌🏻</p>
