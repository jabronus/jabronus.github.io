			<h1>Enjoyment Roundup 001</h1>
			
			<time datetime="2023-01-13">January 13, 2023</time>
		
			<p>So I’ve already been doing this for a bit <a href="https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1560695614165422080?s=20&t=m9_0JNscIE9z0zs6AcZVcw" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, but I figured a longer form version with additional context could be fun. I don’t really have a regular cadence for this in mind — basically whenever I’ve experienced enough different things across various media that pique my interest.</p>
			
			<ul class="roundup">
				<li class="book">
					<h3><a href="https://simpletype.co/products/twenty-bits-websites" target="_blank"><em>Twenty Bits I Learned About Making Websites</em></a> by Dan Cederholm</h3>
					<p>I’ve been a Dan Fan™ for a long while, and have really enjoyed his previous releases in this series. There’s lots of fun little nuggets, but as he says <em>“This is not a book about code.”</em> More of a trip down memory lane to the early days of web standards with some timeless lessons.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="music">
					<h3><a href="https://orcd.co/pollen" target="_blank"><em>Pollen</em></a> by Tennis</h3>
					<p>Sure the album doesn’t come out ‘til February 10, but I still keep listening to the same 2 released tracks over and over. I keep 2020’s <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tennis-swimmer/" target="_blank">Swimmer</a></em> on regular rotation as-is, so I can’t wait for new Tennis tunes to fill my ear holes.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="tv">
					<h3><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/willow/PfeL8yCNXD3r" target="_blank">Willow</a></h3>
					<p>I didn’t grow up with Ron Howard’s 1988 original flick <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/willow/" target="_blank">Willow</a></em>, but I caught it as an adult a few years ago and found it quite charming (doesn’t hurt that Warwick Davis is always a win). I was worried this series would play the usual “soft reboot, same cast 30+ years later, *wink wink nudge nudge* nostalgia card” that’s plagued so many IPs lately; but my wife and I have really enjoyed it! Has its own tone and frequently made us laugh out loud.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="keyboard">
					<h3>Tofu65 with <a href="https://modedesigns.com/collections/switches/products/anthracite-silent-tactile-switches" target="_blank">Anthracite Silent Tactiles</a></h3>
					<p>The trusty ol’ Tofu was my first real mechanical keyboard, and it’s still the most portable one I own. Because of that, it’s also the one I take with me to <a href="https://workthefactory.com" target="_blank">The Factory</a> on coworking days. I’m not a heavy typer, but I’m always keeping my ears on a swivel for making too much noise in public spaces. Lo and behold my delight when <a href="https://modedesigns.com" target="_blank">Mode</a>, some of my favorite keyboard folks, released a silent tactile switch for quiet clackin’. They’re surprisingly good stock, and I haven’t heard any complaints from my desk neighbors.</p>
