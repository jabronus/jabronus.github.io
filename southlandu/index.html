				<h1>Southland University</h1>
				<h3>Initial Ideas &amp; Exploration</h3>

				<p>Southland U is a three-fold institution partering with <a href="http://ccuniversity.edu/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Christian University</a>, comprised of schools in Biblical Study, Ministry, and Leadership. Through these programs, students develop a stronger Biblical foundation and learn how to channel it towards more effective roles in God&rsquo;s ongoing mission in Kentucky and around the globe.</p>

				<h2>The Building</h2>
				
				<p>This concept initially sprang from a desire to try something more unconventional with an institution&rsquo;s visual branding. Gone are the crests and mottos, replaced by an actual building that expands with the school&rsquo;s growth.</p>

				<img class="example" src="school-images/building-animate.gif">

				<p>This sort of structure could be cobbled together from many of an assortment of typical architectural elements (columns, arches, domes, etc.), but I chose to limit it to a classic couple.

				<h2>The Shield</h2>

				<p>It had to be done. There is just too much tradition and instant connotation inherent in a university crest/seal. However, it&rsquo;s been freshened, modernized, and abstracted to remove any stigma or clich&eacute; from the overall concept.</p>

				<img class="example" src="school-images/shield-single.png">

				<p>This shield is made of 4 elements, that fit nicely into 4 categories: the program as a whole, and the 3 individual schools.</p>

				<img class="example" src="school-images/shield-breakdown.png">

				<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at the breakdown:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Biblical Study echoes the shape of an open book being held in a hand.</li>
					<li>Ministry indicates a downward motion, or a &ldquo;pouring out&rdquo; of itself into those below it.</li>
					<li>Leadership crowns the shield, with a slightly distant sphere breaking what were previously rigid boundaries. It has separated itself from the other layers, yet still appears integrated.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The Shield can function on multiple visual levels, indicating its intent through chromatic and typographic references.</p>

			<div id="book" class="section">
				<h2>The Book</h2>

				<p>With the Bible as the foundation for everything we do at Southland, it makes perfect sense to focus on it as the identity for the University&rsquo;s mission.</p>

				<img class="example" src="school-images/book-tiny.png">

				<p>It&rsquo;s also remarkably legible at small sizes...</p>

				<img class="example" src="school-images/book-big.png">

				<p>...with room for additional embellishment at larger sizes.</p>

				<p>Because of this mark&rsquo;s simplicity, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to dilute it with additional visual variations for the individual programs. This could just as esaily be achieved, through geometric and typographic shifts.</p>
