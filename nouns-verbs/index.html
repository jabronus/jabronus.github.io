			<h1 id="Foundation">Biblical Foundation &amp; Description</h1>
			<blockquote>Jesus (n.) said, &ldquo;Come (v.), follow (v.) me (n.)&#8230;&rdquo;  At once they (n.) left (v.) their nets and followed (v.) him (n.).</blockquote>
			<p>I nearly flunked English grammar. Ask Mrs. Harding, my 7th grade grammar teacher and she&rsquo;ll validate that. But this much I know: The word <em>Christian</em> is a noun. A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. And I&rsquo;ve learned over the years that nouns need verbs.</p>
			<p>Jesus loved verbs. Verbs like die, live, come, rest, learn, hear, give, and go. So wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense that the people who claim to follow Jesus would love the same verbs Jesus loved?</p>
			<p>Somewhere along the way someone tried to make the word Christian an adjective. So now people speak of christian (adj.) books and christian (adj.) music and christian (adj.) t-shirts and christian (adj.) schools. When people use the word <em>Christian</em> as an adjective, instead of a noun that loves verbs, it loses its meaning.</p>
			<p>Maybe this explains why so many churches have lost their meaning too.</p>
			<p>If a Christian is a person (singular) who follows Jesus than the Church is a people (plural) who follow Jesus. And like a Christian, the Church is a noun too; a noun that was designed to love verbs. Specifically, a noun that loves the same verbs Jesus loved because the Church is a picture of Jesus.</p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t mean this as an indictment but it seems as though some of us have lost our verbs.</p>
			<p>When we lose our verbs we become what the world claims we are: hypocrites. A hypocrite is nothing more than a noun without a verb. Lovers that don&rsquo;t love&#8230;givers that don&rsquo;t give&#8230;followers that don&rsquo;t follow&#8230;</p>
			<p id="foundation">In <em>Nouns Need Verbs</em> I want to paint a simple picture of a simple person (Christian) and a simple people (Church) who love the verbs Jesus loved.</p>
			<p id="Preface"></p>
		
			<!-- Preface -->

			<h1>Preface</h1>
			<p>Have you noticed the adjectives we put in front of the noun Christian?</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a loving Christian.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a giving Christian.&rdquo;</p>
			<p><em>Loving. Giving.</em></p>
			<p>Is there any other kind of Christian? Can a Christian be a Christian without loving and giving? If a Christian doesn&rsquo;t love or doesn&rsquo;t give is that person really a Christian? Maybe the better way to ask the question is can a Christian be un-loving or un-giving?</p>
			<p>Or have you noticed the adjectives we put in front of the noun <em>Church?</em></p>
			<p>The <em>Baptist</em> Church.</p>
			<p>The <em>Lutheran</em> Church.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>traditional</em> Church.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>contemporary</em> Church.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a <em>black</em> Church.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a <em>white</em> Church.&rdquo;</p>	
			<p>The word that appears before the word Church in the New Testament more than any other word is the word <em>the.</em></p>
			<p>The Church.</p>
			<p>The Church at Philippi&#8230;The Church at Thessalonica&#8230;The Church at Ephesus&#8230;</p>
			<p>I like the word Jesus put in front of the word Church. Jesus told Peter, &ldquo;The gates of hell will not prevail against MY church.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I really like that.</p>
			<p>HIS Church.</p>
			<p>In the same way that the Church belongs to Jesus, I belong to Jesus. And you belong to Jesus.</p> 
			<p>WE belong to Jesus.</p>
			<p>He is THE leader.</p>
			<p>We follow (v.) him (n.)</p>
			<p>When we follow Jesus, we don&rsquo;t need adjectives to describe us.</p>
			<p>I am a <em>Christian.</em></p>
			<p>We are the <em>Church.</em></p>
			<p>Period.</p>
			<p>When we follow Jesus we will love like Jesus loves. When we follow Jesus we will give like Jesus gives.</p>
			<p>So it&rsquo;s not the word before the noun. It&rsquo;s the word after the noun that we need to pay attention to.</p>

			<!-- Introduction: jump (v.) -->
			
			<h1>Introduction: jump (v.)</h1>
			<p>When I was in the 4th grade I was invited to a birthday party at Chris&rsquo; house. I was excited because it was the first birthday party I had been to where girls had also been invited.</p>
			<p>Specifically, Sarah Grossnickle had been invited.</p>
			<p>Her last name is a bit unfortunate. But she had braces. I don&rsquo;t know why I was so enamored with braces as a kid, but I was. Maybe the thought of having rubber bands in my mouth seemed so handy to me. Or maybe it was the thought of having a girl in my class with straight teeth someday.</p>
			<p>I just know I was head over heels in love with Sarah Grossnickle.</p>
			<p>I sent her several notes in class with a box to check. <em>Yes. No. Maybe.</em> On two separate occasions she checked the box that said <em>Maybe.</em> I was about to give her a reason to check the box that said <em>Yes.</em></p>
			<p>Everyone in my class was standing on the deck in Chris&rsquo; back yard. His parents were putting in a pool and had dug a huge hole and there was a huge pile of dirt about 10 feet from the deck. Well as 10-year-old boys do, a dare was thrown out.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Who wants to play Follow the Leader?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I was eating a box of Junior Mints when I accepted the dare. (It was easily my third or fourth box.) I wanted to set the bar high - so high no one would be able to follow me. So I marked off my steps. The drum roll began. And Sarah smiled at me, which was all the motivation I needed.</p>
			<p>I could actually hear the song <em>You&rsquo;re the Inspiration</em> by Chicago playing in my mind as I took off running!</p>
			<p>With a lot of speed and momentum I planted my right foot on the railing of the deck to jump. However, the railing gave way.</p>
			<p>Instead of going up, I went straight down.</p>
			<p>Fortunately for me, a nail caught the edge of my pants slowing me down. Unfortunately for me, that nail ripped my pants completely off and I went sailing head first into a pile of bricks stacked neatly below the deck.</p>
			<p>When I came to, I was sitting in the back of a Cadillac with leather interior in my Fruit of the Looms. And let&rsquo;s just say the &#8216;ol Junior Mints were not agreeing with me. The only tactful way for me to put this is to say I &ldquo;relinquished ownership&rdquo; of the Junior Mints! And there wasn&rsquo;t a product on the market that could clean up the mess I created in the backseat of that luxury automobile. And it wasn&rsquo;t the last emergency room staff I would get acquainted with in life.</p>
			<p>No one followed me that day. I was the only one that day who jumped.</p>
			<p>Somewhere between that deck and the desk where I&rsquo;m sitting right now, I lost the courage to take risks. Some might blame it on maturity. Others might point the finger at intelligence. I think the more birthdays we have, the fewer verbs we have. Our verb vocabulary shrinks with time.</p>
			<p>Somewhere along the way I went to college, got married, had two kids, got a grown-up job, bought a house, started a 401K and somehow ended up driving a mini-van. (I&rsquo;m still not sure how that one happened!)</p>
			<p>In the midst of the &ldquo;have to&rdquo; it&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the &ldquo;get to.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I get to follow Jesus.</p>
			<p>He is THE leader. He is MY leader. He is YOUR leader. He is OUR leader.</p>
			<p>We get to follow Jesus. What a privilege!</p>
			<p>And when we follow Jesus he doesn&rsquo;t lead us to places as much as he leads us to people. That&rsquo;s why there is nothing safe about following Jesus. Following Jesus is simple, but it&rsquo;s not safe.</p>
			<p>So my prayer for you is simple, but not safe. So simple it&rsquo;s a single word. It&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
			<p>Jump.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a verb that is looking for a noun.</p>
			<p>I think YOU are the missing noun.</p>
			<p>Insert your name here: ________________ jumped today.</p>
			<p>It may seem safe to stand on the deck with the rest of the people. But standing on decks is not safe. It&rsquo;s boring.</p>
			<p>So go for it.</p>
			<p>Jump.</p>
			<p>Set down whatever you are holding onto or whatever has a hold of you.</p>
			<p>And jump.</p>
			<p>Helen Keller once said &ldquo;Life is either a daring experience or it&rsquo;s nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Decide today that you are going to follow THE leader. Decide today that you are going to be on a first name basis with the Emergency Room staff in a hospital near you. Decide today that you are going to trade &ldquo;what is&rdquo; for &ldquo;what could be&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jump.</p>

			<!-- Chapter 1: Be -->
			
			<h1>Chapter 1: be (v.)</h1>
			<p>One evening after work I turned onto our street and as I was driving towards the cul-de-sac where our house sits, I saw a little boy, maybe 5 years of age, throw open his front door and burst out.  It was the dead of winter and all he was wearing was his Superman underoos and a bath towel turned cape tied around his neck.</p>
			<p>As I drove down the road, he ran parallel to me on the sidewalk and as I glanced out the passenger side window, he locked eyes with me and smiled!  Did I mention that his mom was chasing him with a wooden spoon yelling, &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It was like a Norman Rockwell painting set in motion.</p>
			<p>The grin on his face was saying, &ldquo;Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty I&rsquo;m free at last!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Later in the spring I saw him buried in a mud puddle up to his neck.  My kind of boy! A few weeks later I watched him jump his bike off a massive pile of dirt, wearing nothing but his skivvies, an oversized motorcycle helmet and a pair of winter gloves. It was like I was watching Evel Knievel jump the fountains at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace again.</p>
			<p>I told my wife Allison, &ldquo;I have to meet this kid!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The very next night I was at the neighborhood park with my two children and I saw him. He was swinging on the swings as high as they could possibly carry him. And as I walked towards him, he jumped at the height of the upswing.  Arms flailing, legs kicking, all I heard was &ldquo;Geronimo!&rdquo;  He hit the ground like a stuntman, rolled through the mulch and jumped to his feet like he was Jason Bourne.</p>
			<p>I said, &ldquo;Son, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He put his hands on his hips and with a super hero pose, he said, &ldquo;My name is Christian.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I nodded my head and said, &ldquo;Oh how fitting.&rdquo;</p>
			<h2>to be (v.) or not to be (v.)</h2>
			<p>A group of masked men recently broke into a department store in the middle of the night and left without anyone noticing.</p>
			<p>The next morning, store managers opened the large building for business and business went on as usual for several hours.</p>
			<p>Until one of the clerks realized that people were getting incredible deals. Deals that were too good to be true - a cashmere sweater for $6&#8230;a designer handbag for $9&#8230;a Swiss watch for $14.</p>
			<p>The thieves left empty-handed, but not before changing most of the prices on most of the items in the store. Yes, the price tags had been switched and very few people had noticed.</p>
			<p>We live in a culture where the same thing has happened. The values have been changed and very few people seem to have noticed.</p>
			<p>The voice whispers, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re valuable if you&rsquo;re pretty. You&rsquo;re valuable if you make a lot of money. You&rsquo;re valuable if you live in the right neighborhood and drive the right car and wear the right clothes.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The price tags have been switched. But people aren&rsquo;t getting a bargain. People are being fleeced and business can&rsquo;t go on as usual because the cost is too high.</p>
			<p>It explains why teenagers cut themselves. It explains why more and more middle-aged women lack the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. It explains why more and more men self-medicate with a bottle of alcohol or prescription pain killers. People either want to sleep through life or numb their way through it.</p>
			<p>We&rsquo;ve become a culture of human doings when we were designed to live as human beings.</p>
			<p>And when we deny our design, we run the risk of destroying our design.</p>
			<p>And the verb <em>be</em> is a verb that flows from the blueprints of our Designer.</p>
			<p>God was. God is. And God will always&#8230;BE.</p>
			<p>And God has invited you to &ldquo;be&rdquo; his child.</p>
			<blockquote>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us that we should be <em>(v.)</em> called the children of God. And that is what we are. - I John 3:1</blockquote>
			<p>When my wife Allison was 28 weeks pregnant with our first child, she called me to let me know that her feet were swollen.  Water retention is not an uncommon occurrence in pregnancy. But just to be safe, she stopped at a drug store to check her blood pressure.</p>
			<p>Sure enough the numbers were sky high.</p>
			<p>So she called our doctor and he invited Allison to come in for a quick check-up. I met her at the hospital thinking it would be a routine visit.</p>
			<p>I could tell from the look on his face that something wasn&rsquo;t right. After running a few tests, he informed us that Allison would need to be on bed rest for the duration of her pregnancy. That was a curve ball that hit us from left field. Twelve weeks is a long time to be in bed. We were not expecting that news.</p>
			<p>After running a series of other tests he informed us that Allison would have to stay in the hospital for the duration of her pregnancy. That was an even bigger blow. And less than an hour later, he sat down on the edge of Allison&rsquo;s bed and I could see the sadness in his body language. He said, &ldquo;I hate to tell you this, but it looks like you are going to deliver your baby within the night.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As those words rolled out of his mouth a team of nurses came in the room and started to hook my wife up to all kinds of machines. It happened so fast. And the tears came just as quickly for us.</p>
			<p>My prayers went from very generic prayers of, &ldquo;God help us deal with this.&rdquo; To very desperate and lonely cries of, &ldquo;God I beg of you&#8230;please work a miracle on behalf of my wife and little girl.</p>
			<p>I would be the first to tell you that I wasn&rsquo;t questioning God. I wasn&rsquo;t asking, &ldquo;Why me? Why my wife? Why my firstborn child?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve lived enough life in this fragile and fallen world to know this truth - God is good even when life isn&rsquo;t good to me.</p>
			<p>By morning, Allison&rsquo;s physical condition had worsened and doctors feared we would lose her life if we didn&rsquo;t deliver the life inside of her. I was tired of being tired. I was scared and worried, but strangely I was excited too. I was going to meet my daughter! I was going to be a dad!</p>
			<p>15 minutes later Ava Joy was born - all 2 pounds of her - 3 months early.</p>
			<p>At least 10 doctors discussed with Allison and I all the potential complications Ava would face in life - hearing loss, blindness, and a litany of other developmental challenges. Honestly, the list was longer than I could have imagined. But at the time, that list didn&rsquo;t matter to me. I was a dad. And dads don&rsquo;t care what their children can or can&rsquo;t do. We love them! And the reason I loved Ava was because she was mine! I helped make her. Part of me was in her.</p>
			<p>In the middle of the night, when no one else was around, I stared into this little glass tube where my little girl was fighting for her life. And it hit me - God had heard all the reports on me. And in spite of how grave they are. In spite of my spiritual pre-maturity, he loves me. Because in the purest, truest sense of the word, God is a dad. And part of him is in me. And part of him is in you.</p>
			<p>I stood over Ava&rsquo;s incubator and I wanted what was best for her. Whatever the cost, whatever the procedure, I pleaded with doctors to do what they could to help her live. And I read the Bible and it is a love letter from a lovesick dad to his homesick children. And in it he says, &ldquo;Whatever the cost, whatever the procedure - even if it means giving my life for yours - I will do it, I will go through it for you!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I stood over Ava&rsquo;s incubator and I watched medical professionals cut my daughter, poke her, prod her and put her through the proverbial medical ringer. And through all of it, I didn&rsquo;t want her to go through it alone. So I would sit by her bed. I would stand by her bed. I would eat and sleep by her bed. I wanted her to hear and know my voice. And I read the Bible and I hear the voice of my Father say, &ldquo;Never will I leave you; never will I abandon you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I stood over Ava&rsquo;s incubator and I was so proud. I used to sing <em>Jesus loves you (Ava) this I know. For the Bible tells me so.</em> And I would get to that part in the song that says <em>Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong,</em> and I would cry. My daughter was so small I could fit my wedding band over her thigh. I still can&rsquo;t sing that song without crying because of Zephaniah&rsquo;s words:</p>
			<blockquote>The Lord your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing.</blockquote>
			<p>You have a Dad who sings over you. He&rsquo;s so proud of you. The Bible teaches that he has your name written on the palm of his hand - the same hand that took a nail for you.</p>
			<p>He didn&rsquo;t go through that pain so that you would spend your entire life questioning whether or not he really loves you. He REALLY loves you.</p>
			<p>And before you can BE his follower, you have to BE His child.</p>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
			<p id="Love"></p>
			
			<!-- Chapter 2: Love -->
			
			<h1>Chapter 2: love (v.)</h1>
			<p>It was a Saturday morning. When I lived in Haiti that was the morning I went to the open-air market to buy my food for the week.</p>
			<p>I was standing in the middle of the street holding a bag filled with oranges and rice and beans. And that is when I saw him.</p>
			<p>It was like a page had been torn out of a <em>National Geographic</em> magazine and framed for me to stare at.</p>
			<p>He was crippled. His legs were disproportionate in size to the rest of his body and they were bent at an angle that was unfamiliar to a healthy torso. His head was bowed in shame, but I could tell he was blind. His eyes never really fixed on any particular object rather they danced from side to side and followed the noises around him. He was barely clothed and his body was caked with dust and dirt. His hair was matted down from sweat and flies took up residence on his skin.</p>
			<p>His hands were outstretched. He was holding a small bowl. He was begging.</p>
			<p>I watched as one person after another passed by him&#8230;ignored him&#8230;pretended he didn&rsquo;t exist. It seems easier that way.</p>
			<p>Then he pulled a small board from his bag and placed it in the sewage that runs beside the road. Backing it&rsquo;s flow up, he did something I wish I could scrub from conscience. He placed his hands in the raw sewage and began to sift and search as if he was looking for something of value. Living in Haiti I watched a woman drink from a mud puddle and I caught two men eating my garbage, but this was a new low.</p>
			<p>My heart broke and scattered into pieces I will not recover this side of heaven.</p>
			<p>I watched as he pulled out an old battery. He cleaned it off like it was it was a rare artifact missing from a prestigious museum.</p>
			<p>With tears streaming down my cheeks, I knelt down in front of him and took his dirty hands and placed them on my face and in Kreyol said, &ldquo;My name is Jon and I want to be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He said, &ldquo;My parents broke my legs when I was a baby so that I could beg and bring in money for our family.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I filled his empty bag with my bag full of food. I filled his pocket with my pocket full of money.</p>
			<p>Love empties itself, because Love emptied Himself.</p>
			<p>Jesus asked a blind man named Bartimaeus, &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s always the question that love asks.</p>
			<p>What can I do for you?</p>
			<p>I have a friend named Donnie. When Donnie was 6 years old he watched his dad nearly beat his mom to death. The trauma of that episode locked Donnie into a permanent state of child-likeness. Though he is 52 years of age today, Donnie thinks and acts and communicates like a 6-year-old.</p>
			<p>Donnie loves me and I love Donnie.</p>
			<p>He has taught me a lot about love.</p>
			<p>Donnie washed dishes at a local restaurant for two decades. Each Friday he would cash his paycheck and each Saturday he would ride his bike from one garage sale to the next buying albums and paper novels and costume jewelry.</p>
			<p>Donnie has a Christmas gift list with 385 people on it. Donnie loves people and people love Donnie. So much so that he spends his entire year Christmas shopping for all the people he loves.</p>
			<p>One of my prized possessions is a ring that looks like it came from a gumball machine. And maybe it did. I don&rsquo;t really care WHERE it came from because I know WHO it came from.</p>
			<p>I know it came from Donnie. I know it came from Donnie&rsquo;s heart.</p>
			<p>Donnie understands Christmas better than most people do.</p>
			<p>Donnie couldn&rsquo;t tell you WHERE Jesus came from. But Donnie does know WHO sent Jesus. And Donnie knows WHY the Father sent Jesus.</p>
			<p>Love.</p>
			<p>Donnie doesn&rsquo;t know a stranger. When he meets people for the first time, he hugs them. And he doesn&rsquo;t let go! When Donnie hugs people, he holds on to people! And it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are, once Donnie learns your name, your name finds its way on to his Christmas list. From the mayor of our city to the homeless men in Phoenix Park, Donnie knows a lot of people by name.</p>
			<p>Donnie looks a lot like love.</p>
			<p>Love holds on. Love gives. Love knows.</p>
			<p>Donnie is on a fixed income. God isn&rsquo;t.</p>
			<p>God never runs out of anything.</p>
			<p>The Bible teaches, &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo; Which means he never runs out of love. No matter how great the demand for love is, God is never in short supply.</p>
			<p>And what I love about God is he doesn&rsquo;t love things the way people do. God loves people.</p>
			<p>More specifically, God loves you.</p>
			<p>He wants to hold you, give to you, and know you. And He wants you to do the same for others.</p>
			<p>John once wrote, Whoever does not love (v.) does not know God, because God is love.</p>
			<p>John referred to himself as &ldquo;the disciple whom Jesus loved.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>How do you refer to yourself?</p>
			<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel loved, it&rsquo;s not because you aren&rsquo;t loved.</p>
			<p>One of the ways to get love is to give love.</p>
			<p>Most Tuesdays I stand on a corner in the downtown district of my hometown with a sign that says &ldquo;Free Hugs.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve done it for over a decade now. One man looked at my sign for awhile, shrugged his shoulders in a disappointed kind of way and said, &ldquo;I thought it said &#8216;Free Hogs&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Only in Kentucky would someone be sad that I wasn&rsquo;t giving away free farm animals!</p>
			<p>My favorite street corner is across the street from the courthouse. As part of their sentence for breaking the law, a local judge sends those he convicts to me and as part of their punishment they have to hug me!</p>
			<p>I get a lot of &ldquo;side&rdquo; hugs from the men.</p>
			<p>One lady rode up on a bike not too long ago and said, &ldquo;What does your sign say?&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t read. So I told her what it said. She cocked her head to the side and took another drag on the cigarette she was smoking. Then she squinted her eyes and said, &ldquo;Are you for real?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I said, &ldquo;Come a little closer and find out.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>So she got off her bike and I went in for the kill.</p>
			<p>When I tried to pull away from her she pulled me in tighter. She buried her head in my chest and said, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s hugged me in a long time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When nobody hugs you, you begin to feel like a nobody.</p>
			<p>Nobody is a nobody to God. Everybody is a somebody to God.</p>
			<p>And one of the ways we experience His love for us is by giving his love to others.</p>
			<p>And there&rsquo;s no way to give love away without getting closer.</p>
			<p>God came down and love came with Him.</p>
			<p>God didn&rsquo;t try to love us at a distance. And God doesn&rsquo;t stiff-arm anyone who needs to be loved.</p>
			<p>God doesn&rsquo;t give side hugs.</p>
			<p id="See"></p>

			<h1>Chapter 3: see (v.)</h1>
			<p>My dad died of cancer.</p>
			<p>I hate cancer.</p>
			<p>I love my dad.</p>
			<p>Although the cancer ravaged his mouth and throat, it did not lay hold of his mind and his heart, nor did it blur his vision. </p>
			<p>One afternoon I was sitting beside the chair he was resting in feeding him ice chips and I noticed his eyes were moving around a lot.  He smiled several times, so finally I looked around the family room and asked, &ldquo;Dad what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He could only whisper so I leaned in and he said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see them?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I looked around the room again. From my perspective the room was empty. So I said, &ldquo;No dad, I don&rsquo;t see THEM. What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He pulled me close and said, &ldquo;Son, there are children everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>We both started to cry.</p>
			<p>I asked, &ldquo;Tell me dad, what do THEY look like?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In spite of the pain, he smiled from ear to ear and said, &ldquo;Son THEY&rsquo;RE so beautiful and so full of life.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A few hours later and just a few hours away from his death, he looked past all of us seated at the table and fixed his eyes on my mom who was washing dishes at the kitchen sink. And he said to my mom, &ldquo;Carol do you feel that?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She turned off the water, dried her hands and said, &ldquo;Feel what?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He said, &ldquo;The two hands in the middle of your back.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>My siblings and I stopped what we were doing as he smiled at my mom and said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s holding you&#8230;he knows you&rsquo;re weak, he knows you&rsquo;re tired, and he just wants you to know that he&rsquo;s strong enough for both of you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;The pure in heart will see God.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A holy heart is required to see a holy God.</p>
			<p>I want to see God.</p>
			<p>New York City has more nearsighted people than any other city in the U.S. Ophthalmologists believe the phenomenon is due to residents using their eyes repeatedly for short distances due to tall buildings.</p>
			<p>Too often spiritual nearsightedness limits what I see and how far I can see.</p>
			<p>And more importantly WHO I see.</p>
			<p>One morning when I was teaching in Haiti, I had my students close their eyes and put their heads down on their desk and with the finite means of language I attempted to paint a picture of the infinite beauty of heaven. Afterwards I had my students raise their heads from their desk and one little girl who shared a bed with 5 siblings each night, asked, &ldquo;Mr. Jon, will I have my own bed in heaven?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>My response? &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Another little girl who came to school undernourished asked, &ldquo;Will we get to eat whatever we want in heaven?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>My response? &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And one little boy in the back whose dad drown and whose mom died in a fire said, &ldquo;I want to see him! I want to see Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>My response? &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I want to see Jesus.</p>
			<p>Paul said, &ldquo;We walk by faith and not by sight.&rdquo;</p>

			<h1>Chapter 6: dance (v.)</h1>
			<p>My cousin Kathy was born with Downs Syndrome.</p>
			<p>Every year when our family would gather at my grandparent&rsquo;s house in western Kansas, Kathy would set up all of the birthday cards she had received the previous year on the kitchen table and explain why each one meant so much to her.</p>
			<p>She also loved to show us the engagement ring that her &ldquo;boyfriend&rdquo; had given her. The wedding wasn&rsquo;t scheduled for a specific date on the calendar rather each year she would tell us, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting married in 14 years!&rdquo; My two older brothers were going to be ushers. I was assigned the distinct role of ring bearer. But as each year passed I explained to her that if I had to wait 14 more years, I might just be the oldest ring bearer in human history! Kathy would laugh and give me one of her signature hugs.</p>
			<p>Hugging Kathy made me realize how beautiful life is.</p>
			<p>Kathy added beauty to this life for 48 years.</p>
			<p>I miss hugging Kathy. It was a privilege. But what I really miss is Kathy hugging me.</p>
			<p>Someday you&rsquo;ll get to experience a hug from Kathy. I can&rsquo;t imagine heaven would be complete without her welcoming people to the party.</p>
			<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately what this idea is about.</p>
			<p>A party. <em>The</em> party.</p>
			<p>Where I&rsquo;m from we call it Prom Night.</p>
			<p>I wish I could remember my prom night. It was such a blur, a hurried mess of getting dressed, taking pictures, eating out and hanging out that I really don&rsquo;t remember much of it. I guess it was too much like every other prom so I&rsquo;ve chosen to forget it.</p>
			<p>But I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the second prom I went to. I will always remember it.</p>
			<p>And the reason I will always remember it is because all of the people who were never invited to a High School prom were invited to this one.</p>
			<p>Beautiful people like my cousin Kathy.</p>
			<p>Beautiful people like my friend Audrey.</p>
			<p>I pay the bills by standing on a stage each weekend and teaching thousands of people to love people. It&rsquo;s a rewarding gig.</p>
			<p>Audrey sits on the front row each weekend and after listening to me for 10 minutes she usually gets up and goes to the bathroom. It&rsquo;s also a very humbling gig.</p>
			<p>During one of my talks Audrey stood up, but instead of walking to the back of the room where the bathrooms are located, she turned to the crowd and motioned for all of them to stand up too. Trust me, I hadn&rsquo;t said anything profound. Audrey just felt led to give me a standing ovation. She started to clap and cheer and when no one else joined her, she turned around a second time and put both hands on her hips as if to say, &ldquo;I mean it people! Get up off you&rsquo;re lazy can and give this man a round of applause!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Three seconds later I received a standing ovation from 3,000 people.</p>
			<p>I thanked Audrey and she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome Jon!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And then she stood on her chair, took a bow and received a round of applause!</p>
			<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;When you throw a party, don&rsquo;t invite your friends, brothers, relatives or rich neighbors, for they will repay you by inviting you to their party. Instead, when you throw a party invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>We decided to throw a party for Audrey and her friends.</p>
			<p>So we sent out an invitation to physically and mentally challenged people living in our city and we asked them to come to prom with us.</p>
			<p>We invited local tuxedo stores and formal dress stores to provide free attire for our guests to wear. And they did!</p>
			<p>We invited local restaurants to cater the event. And they did!</p>
			<p>We invited local limousine owners to pick up and deliver our privileged friends. And they did!</p>
			<p>We invited tailors and seamstresses to make sure every article of clothing fit like it had been custom made for a runway in SOHO. Whether they were wheel chair bound, bent over, or missing a leg - who better to be adorned in the finest of clothing!</p>
			<p>We rolled out the red carpet and we handed hundreds of disposable cameras to Middle School students who played the role of the paparazzi. We hung disco balls and strobe lights and put a live band on stage to cover the best Motown has to offer.</p>
			<p>And as thousands of people poured in something magical happened in the universe. A new normal was defined. A new flavor of love was showcased. A new picture of perfection was captured.</p>
			<p>If Jesus were anywhere on the planet that night, he would have been in that room on that dance floor cutting a rug with the first class citizens of Lexington, Kentucky.</p>
			<p>Someone more perceptive than me once observed, &ldquo;Grace is the face love wears when it meets imperfection.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The many people who have put up with me, not given up on me, included me, and helped me, have all looked at me through the lens of grace.</p>
			<p>Prom night has changed how I look at people.</p>
			<p>Prom night has changed how I look at me.</p>
			<p>Prom night has changed how I look at love.</p>
			<p>Brady is my friend with autism and Brady loves two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Being naked.</li>
				<li>Being naked in water.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I love Brady.</p>
			<p>Andrew is my friend who lives with Fragile X Syndrome and Andrew hates one thing:</p>
			<blockquote>Silence.</blockquote>
			<p>So Andrew fills the air with cuss words when it gets too quiet. There is nothing like a prayer time in church to bring out the sailor in Andrew.</p>
			<p>I love Andrew.</p>
			<p>When I was a little boy my family picked up a man named Charlie and we took him to church with us. There were Sundays when I felt like Charlie was taking us to church.</p>
			<p>When Charlie&rsquo;s mom went to the hospital to deliver him, her doctor was at a Christmas party. He showed up in the delivery room intoxicated and angry.</p>
			<p>He was angry because he had to leave the party.</p>
			<p>So he pushed on her stomach. It was her first pregnancy so she didn&rsquo;t know the protocol. She assumed his behavior was standard procedure. But standard medical procedure doesn&rsquo;t take the life of a young mom.</p>
			<p>Not only did Charlie never meet the mom who gave him life, Charlie did not receive enough oxygen in the process and was born with Cerebral Palsy.</p>
			<p>His mind works, but his body does not.</p>
			<p>For the first 12 years of Charlie&rsquo;s life Charlie&rsquo;s dad carried Charlie everywhere he needed to go.</p>
			<p>Charlie&rsquo;s dad is one of the finest men I&rsquo;ve ever known.</p>
			<p>My family had the privilege of taking Charlie to church every Sunday for more than a decade. We took Charlie until Charlie started telling his friends about his friend Jesus.</p>
			<p>Our wood-paneled station wagon lacked the seating capacity necessary to get Charlie and his friends from the group home they lived in to church. So we started using the church van.</p>
			<p>Seating capacity&#8230; 16 adults.</p>
			<p>By the time I was in high school, the first two rows of my home church were filled with Charlie and his friends.</p>
			<p>If a man, who is considered limited by worldly standards, knows enough to talk about Jesus to his friends, what&rsquo;s my excuse?</p>
			<p>Hearing Charlie sing, Oh How I Love Jesus, was one of the highlights of my life. I know Jesus loves Charlie. And I know Charlie loves Jesus.</p>
			<p>Though I didn&rsquo;t always understand Charlie when he talked, Charlie always understood something I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
			<p>Everybody&rsquo;s odd but God.</p>
			<p>That sounds like something you would put on a sign that Cracker Barrel would sell. But it&rsquo;s true. God is the only standard of normal.</p>
			<p>Everybody except God is challenged.</p>
			<p>Your senior class could make <em>your</em> prom <em>their</em> prom. The average high school senior spends $1,100 on prom. What if your class collected and spent it&rsquo;s money throwing a party unlike any party anyone has ever been to?</p>
			<p>20 years from now, you won&rsquo;t forget it! You&rsquo;ll remember it!</p>
			<p>You could throw a prom in an apartment, in a barn, or in the backyard. Prom could take place on a beach, on a cul-de-sac, on a bridge or in the middle of a field.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, there&rsquo;s nothing like seeing a sea of challenged people do the Dougie!</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s also nothing like being goosed by a 52-year-old woman who is wheel chair bound either! (Not that I have first hand experience with that or anything!)</p>
			<p>Wherever and whenever you throw the party, what you will learn is this: What we love is never more important than who we love.</p>
			<p>Mephibosheth.</p>
			<p>For those of you looking to give your son a unique name, it&rsquo;s an option.</p>
			<p>Mephibosheth ate his meals at a king&rsquo;s table.</p>
			<p>And not just any king, but King David.</p>
			<p>Because his feet didn&rsquo;t work, someone carried Mephibosheth to King David&rsquo;s table every day.</p>
			<p>When I close my eyes I can see it&#8230;I can see a man scooping Mephibosheth off the sidewalk and carrying him into the palace, past the group of boys that taunted and teased him every day on the playground.</p>
			<p>And I can see Mephibosheth sitting next to King David as David tells those gathered around the table what it was like to see Goliath hit the ground.</p>
			<p>What would happen if all of us put an extra chair at our dinner tables each night and invited someone like Mephibosheth to join us?</p>
			<p>My parents did it for all kinds of overlooked people. The homeless and the hitchhiker broke bread with us. And so did more refugees than I can count.</p>
			<p>My parents opened up their home to Vietnamese refugees after the war ended. I cannot remember a time in my childhood when my parents weren&rsquo;t helping someone escape the horrors of war-torn Vietnam.</p>
			<p>And of all the refugees who found peace at our dining room table, I think everyone in my family would agree that Cuc is our favorite.</p>
			<p>She has polio.</p>
			<p>When Cuc would walk the streets of Saigon, people would pinch her and yell at her because they believed she had done something evil in a previous life to offend an ancestor and in her reincarnated life was being punished for it.</p>
			<p>For months, every time Cuc would eat with us, her family shunned her. They would lift her pant leg revealing a stunted leg and they would shake their head in disgust at her.</p>
			<p>My mom put a stop to that.</p>
			<p>My mom only stands 5 feet 2 inches off the ground but she is a spiritual giant.</p>
			<p>My mom explained to Cuc that she was a child of God.</p>
			<p>My mom introduced Cuc to Jesus. Jesus healed legs like the one Cuc&rsquo;s family made fun of.</p>
			<p>And someday Jesus is going to throw a party for people like Cuc and people like my mom.</p>
			<p>I want to invite you to our Prom Night in Lexington.</p>
			<p>We call it Jesus Prom.</p>
			<p>Plan on smiling a lot.</p>
			<p>Plan on crying a lot.</p>
			<p>Plan on dancing a lot.</p>
			<p>Plan on meeting Jesus and experiencing what heaven will be like.</p>
			<p>All you need to know are the hand motions to Y-M-C-A&#8230; and maybe the Macarena.</p>
			<p>And all you need to bring is a big heart.</p>
			<p>You&rsquo;ll get more love than you give&#8230; way more!</p>
			<p>And you&rsquo;ll see why <em>who</em> we love is always more important than <em>what</em> we love.</p>

			<!-- Chapter 7: Give -->
			
			<h1>Chapter 7: give (v.)</h1>
			<p>An 8-year-old Jesus follower in our church, named Jacob, went door to door in his neighborhood making himself available to do odd jobs. He took all the money he earned and all the money he had saved in his piggy bank and he went to the mall to buy the nicest winter coat he could find.</p>
			<p>The reason?</p>
			<p>His buddy at school stood on the playground during recess in an old over-sized sweatshirt shivering because his parents couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy him a coat.</p>
			<p>So on Christmas morning, Jacob handed his buddy a $160 North Face Coat and said, &ldquo;Jesus wants me to give this to you!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He then generously reached into his pocket and pulled out $37 and said, &ldquo;This is all the money I have left and I want you to use it to buy whatever your family needs.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Galatians 5:6 says, &ldquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The only thing that counts?</p>
			<p>Yes, the only thing!</p>
			<p>Rebecca, a 6-year-old girl, baked brownies and stood at the entrance to the library at the University of Kentucky and gave a free brownie to any college student who walked by during finals week.</p>
			<p>One Muslim student stopped and said, &ldquo;Why are you giving away free brownies to total strangers?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Rebecca is sassy. So, she put her hand on her hip, and with a &ldquo;no duh&rdquo; kind of tone said, &ldquo;Because Jesus wants me to. That&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Little did she know that this Muslim student had been wrestling with what he believed, and had been questioning the tenants of his faith for over 2 years. Dumbfounded by her emphatic response he said, &ldquo;Can I come to church with you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Before consulting her parents, she quickly said, &ldquo;Sure you can!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>So here&rsquo;s my favorite part - instead of bringing this PhD. student into the big room with all the big people, she took him into her children&rsquo;s ministry environment where he sat on the floor and heard a lesson about Jesus&rsquo; love for Zacchaeus.</p>
			<p>After months of sitting and listening he took a stand for Jesus and was baptized.</p>
			<p>His family told him they would kill him if they ever saw him.</p>
			<p>As scary as that threat sounds, he&rsquo;s safe.</p>
			<p>He&rsquo;s safe because of the protective love of the Father.</p>
			<p>And all of it happened because a little girl partnered with Betty Crocker and the Holy Spirit.</p>
			<p>Galatians 5:6 says, &ldquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The only thing that counts?</p>
			<p>Yes, the only thing!</p>
			<p>I challenged our church family to go to every restaurant in town and buy as many meals for strangers as possible and leave as many big tips as possible.</p>
			<p>One high school student went to the bank and emptied out his savings account. He had been saving for a car. He went to the Waffle House and as he got to know his waitress, he felt like God was saying, &ldquo;She needs help.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>So he ordered a 75&#162; cup of hot chocolate, then put $1,000 in an envelope, stuck the envelope between the salt and pepper shaker, went outside and hid in the bushes to watch her reaction. When she opened it, she put her hand over her face and started to cry. So overcome by emotion, she sat down in the booth as he ran back inside and hugged her.</p>
			<p>He learned that she was a single mom trying to raise two teenagers by working three jobs. She and her children are now part of our church family and someday you&rsquo;ll get to meet them because a high school student decided, &ldquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>15 minutes later at the same Waffle House, another family from our church walked in and ordered breakfast. Their waiter was a struggling college student who was behind on his bills and had just been told that he would not be able to return the following semester until he paid off his debt. To make matters more frustrating, his car had broken down and he couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay for the repairs, which meant he couldn&rsquo;t get to and from work.</p>
			<p>So the family went to the very same bank the high school student had gone to and the parents emptied one of accounts and they took a check back to the restaurant. They wrote him a note that said, &ldquo;We believe in you and want you to be able to pursue your dream of being an artist, so this should cover your debt and the next two years of college. We&rsquo;ve also enclosed the keys to our car&#8230;it&rsquo;s the blue Volvo sitting next to the newspaper stand outside&#8230;Jesus gave his life up for us, so it seems the least we could do would be to give you our car.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And they walked home that day!</p>
			<p>Like the Muslim student, like the struggling single mom, that young waiter didn&rsquo;t need much convincing to give his life to Jesus because he had seen Jesus in that family.</p>
			<p>Galatians 5:6 says, &ldquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The only thing that counts?</p>
			<p>Yes, the only thing!</p>
			<p>I recently applied for a job at the Waffle House in hopes that someone would give me a blue Volvo!</p>
			<p>I John 2 says: &ldquo;If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>An hour after reading that passage recently I met a young couple in need of a car.</p>
			<p>I handed them the keys to my car.</p>
			<p>My wife empties our checking account every so often and gives the money to someone in need.</p>
			<p>We don&rsquo;t do it to earn a better standing with God. We do it to make sure we know where we stand with God.</p>
			<p>We have a generosity yardstick at Southland that says <em>generosity is not measured by how much we give away. Generosity is measured by how much we keep for ourselves.</em></p>
			<p>My routine is I fill up on the goodness of God early in the morning. That way I have something to give away throughout the rest of the day.</p>
			<p>I like to go to bed empty.</p>
			<p>I live with the most giving people on the planet.</p>
			<p>People who birthed a clinic that provides free medical care to 3,500 uninsured people in our city. People who feed 3,500 hungry people every day. People who have given 500 homeless men and women a free place to live and a job to restore their dignity. People who rebuilt an entire Indonesian city after a tsunami wiped it off the map.</p>
			<p>If there is a basin of water and a towel and two dirty feet to wash, I know 14,000 people who will fight for the privilege of washing those feet.</p>
			<p>I had a lawn mowing business as a kid. I made six dollars each time I mowed one person&rsquo;s yard. One summer I mowed fourteen yards each week. I made eighty-four dollars a week. I put all my hard earned dollars in a shoebox under my bed. From time to time I would pull that shoebox out and I would dump those dollars on my bed and I would count them&#8230;one, two, three, four, five&#8230;you can buy a lot of baseball cards and Mountain Dew with eighty-four dollars! For every ten dollars I made my dad challenged me to give one dollar away.</p>
			<p>So every week I gave away eight dollars and forty cents.</p>
			<p>At the age of eleven I took a homeless man to McDonalds and I bought him something warm to eat. His name was Kevin.</p>
			<p>My dad drove. But I paid.</p>
			<p>I learned that Kevin&rsquo;s wife died in a house fire three years after they were married. Kevin blamed himself.</p>
			<p>I learned that Kevin needed more than food. Kevin needed someone to listen to him.</p>
			<p>Listening may be the greatest form of love.</p>
			<p>People need us to listen to them.</p>
			<p>I learned how to listen that day.</p>
			<p>I learned how to love that day.</p>
			<p>That summer I bought baseball cleats for a boy named Chico whose dad was in prison. I bought a pillow for a woman named Helen in a nursing home.  I bought school supplies for a Vietnamese refugee named Hien. I also bought three tickets to the movie E.T. for my buddies Clint, Jesse, and Tim.</p>
			<p>My dad drove. I paid.</p>
			<p>But what I received was far greater than what I gave.</p>
			<p>Eight dollars and forty cents.</p>
			<p>Mowing yards took on a greater purpose.</p>
			<p>I learned that giving was better than getting.</p>
			<p>I also learned that names matter. Kevin, Chico, Helen, and Hien&#8230;as well as Clint, Jesse, and Tim. Names matter because people matter.</p>
			<p>My dad&rsquo;s name was Roy.</p>
			<p>His shoebox and his heart were much bigger than mine.</p>
			<p>He was the most generous man I have ever known.</p>
			<p>He taught me the value of one life.</p>
			<p>He taught me the value of one dollar.</p>
			<p>Four quarters. Ten dimes. One hundred pennies.</p>
			<p>I was watching CNBC one evening and the host was discussing the value of the American dollar with a panel of economists. They were bemoaning the fact that the American dollar was depreciating. I&rsquo;m not an economist. Nor do I make or have a lot of dollars.</p>
			<p>So I&rsquo;m sure on many levels the host was probably right.</p>
			<p>But&#8230;</p>
			<p>I think the American dollar still has value.</p>
			<p>My kids have a piggy bank full of pennies.</p>
			<p>They love to dump the pennies on the floor and count them. Stacks of Abraham Lincolns. One hundred Abraham Lincolns equals one George Washington. Historians might disagree with that but economists won&rsquo;t.</p>
			<p>How do I teach my kids the value of one dollar?</p>
			<p>3 billion people live on less than one dollar a day.</p>
			<p>I can&rsquo;t sleep because of that reality&#8230;</p>
			<p>CNN reported from Somalia tonight where five hundred thousand children are expected to die in the next two months of acute starvation.</p>
			<p>Every five minutes the United States spends six and a half million dollars to pay down the interest on the more than fourteen trillion dollars we owe.</p>
			<p>We spend three hundred and ninety million dollars a day on interest payments alone.</p>
			<p>Giving is better than spending.</p>
			<p>Could anyone benefit from less spending and more giving?</p>
			<p>I believe everyone could benefit from less spending and more giving.</p>
			<p>Stop spending. Start giving.</p>
			<p>When I lived in Haiti I caught a man eating three-day-old macaroni out of my garbage. Thinking I would report him to the police for stealing he begged me for forgiveness. Both of us started to cry. His tears were tears of desperation. My tears were tears of devastation. I begged him for forgiveness.</p>
			<p>I decided that day to spend less and give more.</p>
			<p>One child dies from starvation every five seconds.</p>
			<p>In the five minutes it took me to type this section 300 children died.</p>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s give more so more can live.</p>
			<p>I am not a mathematician.</p>
			<p>My wife keeps our checkbook balanced.</p>
			<p>She also keeps me balanced.</p>
			<p>I do understand the power of multiplication.</p>
			<p>One by itself is not a large number. But multiply one by any other number other than one and the number grows.</p>
			<p>If one person asks me to help them and I give them one dollar, that one dollar does not have the potential to change that one person&rsquo;s life. But what if ten people all gave one dollar to that one person in need? Or what if one hundred people gave one dollar to that one person in need? Or what if one hundred thousand people gave one dollar to that one person in need?</p>
			<p>Change is possible because multiplication changes everything.</p>
			<p>The potential for change is greater with WE than ME.</p>
			<p>I work with a lot of people in need.</p>
			<p>I have a lot of friends who want to help people in need.</p>
			<p>So we started a Dollar Club.</p> 
			<p>Bad name. Good idea.</p>
			<p>We meet every weekend. And every weekend everyone gives one dollar to help one person in need.</p>
			<p>No money spent to give money away. No committees. No hidden fees. No administrative costs. No fine print. No extra charges. No hoops to jump through. No bureaucracy. No government. No red tape. No middleman.</p>
			<p>You give a dollar. Someone gets a dollar.</p>
			<p>We give fourteen thousand one dollar bills. Someone gets fourteen thousand one dollar bills.</p>
			<p>Giving has gone up in a down economy.</p>
			<p>It is the economics of love.</p>
			<p>You will never miss the dollar you give away. Never. Ever.</p>
			<p>You will miss the opportunity to change a person&rsquo;s life.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s change for a dollar.</p>
			<p>As a follower among followers, I invite people to bring heaven to earth. Heaven is more of a people than it is a place. And heaven is synonymous with hope. Everyone I know needs hope. The poorest people on the planet are the people without hope. When we bring heaven to earth we bring hope to people. When we bring hope to people we end poverty.</p>
			<p>I have a friend who is a billionaire. I have a friend who pulls pennies out of the sewage to survive. Without hope both men are poor men. With hope both men are rich men.</p>
			<p>Hope is the reason one dollar can change the world.</p>
			<p>A choir. A senior class. A bowling league. A motorcycle gang. Your office, your family, your neighborhood, your team. The guys you play golf with, the women you play bunko with, the friends you vacation with - everyone giving hope to someone.</p>
			<p>Giving one dollar for one person who cannot afford to eat, cannot afford a pair of glasses, cannot afford a winter coat, cannot afford school supplies, cannot afford their prescription medicine, cannot afford their electric bill.</p>
			<p>And what about our gatherings?</p>
			<p>From basketball arenas to football stadiums. From U2 concerts to Wimbledon. From graduations to bingo halls. From dorms to barracks. From art festivals to marathons. From Apple to Nike. From conversations Bill Gates has with Warren Buffet. From country churches to city churches. From the United Nations to the halls of Congress. What if every time we gathered we passed the hat and put a dollar in.</p>
			<p>One hundred senators equals one hundred dollars. Give one hundred dollars a week to a coach or a teacher in the inner city and they can multiply it like the fish and the bread.</p>
			<p>What if every day, every week, every month, every year, everyone who could give a dollar gave a dollar?</p>
			<p>Who knows, maybe a jar filled with one dollar bills sitting in every government building will convict elected officials to spend less than they bring in. Who knows, maybe a balanced budget will lead to a balanced perspective.</p>
			<p>Heaven on earth. Hope on earth.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a perspective.</p>
			<p>Sarah&rsquo;s husband committed suicide. He left her with three children and thousands of dollars of debt. He blamed his death on her. Sarah worked two jobs for ten years to pay off the debt. Before she could make the final payment to the bank she learned she was going to die if she didn&rsquo;t have a surgery to repair her heart. Sarah did not have health insurance. Sarah did not have the fourteen thousand dollars needed to pay for the surgery.</p>
			<p>Once again Sarah&rsquo;s heart was broken.</p>
			<p>Someone told me about Sarah&rsquo;s need and I shared her need with our church.</p>
			<p>I did not know Sarah. I still do not know Sarah.</p>
			<p>I invited every one in our church to give one dollar. We took fourteen thousand dollars and we gave it to the doctor who told Sarah she needed fourteen thousand dollars to repair her heart.</p>
			<p>I called Sarah to let her know.</p>
			<p>Sarah cried.</p>
			<p>Sarah&rsquo;s heart is healing.</p>
			<p>That is change for a dollar.</p>
			<blockquote>I can&rsquo;t sleep.
				I need to sleep.
				God doesn&rsquo;t sleep.
				God doesn&rsquo;t sleep so we can.
				Why can&rsquo;t I sleep?
				Maybe God wants me to think about what he thinks about.
				Maybe there is a reason God doesn&rsquo;t sleep.
				Maybe that reason is people.
				People in need&#8230;

			<p>My dad once told me - If it&rsquo;s worth anything it will cost something.</p>
			<p>Jesus proved that.</p>
			<p>One dollar is a small cost.</p>

			<p>When I give others get.</p>
			<p>And what I give is what others get.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m giving more than a dollar.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m giving love.</p>
			<p>Love changes everything.</p>

			<h1>Chapter 10: remember (v.)</h1>
			<p>The Vietnam Veteran&rsquo;s Memorial in Washington D.C. is striking for its simplicity.</p>
			<p>Etched in a black granite wall are the names of 58,156 Americans who died in the Vietnam War. Since its opening in 1982, that stark monument has stirred deep emotions.</p>
			<p>Some visitors walk its length slowly, almost reverently without pause. Others stop before certain names, remembering their son or fiancé or fellow soldier, wiping away tears, tracing the names with their fingers.</p>
			<p>For three Vietnam veterans - Robert Bedker, Willard Craig, and Darrall Lausch - a visit to the memorial must be especially poignant, for they can walk up to the long ebony wall and find their own names carved in the stone.</p>
			<p>Because of a clerical error, each of them was incorrectly listed as killed in action; they were thought to be dead, when really, they are alive.</p>
			<p>In my mind I make the journey up the hill to Golgotha every day. It&rsquo;s a war memorial I need to visit.</p>
			<p>I do not want to forget the cross.</p>
			<p>Rembrandt painted a picture of the cross. His rendering is really no different than most Renaissance paintings - a hill, three crosses, a dark sky, and a crowd.</p>
			<p>What separates Rembrandt&rsquo;s painting from other depictions of the crucifixion is a man who stands in the crowd dressed in 17th century clothing.</p>
			<p>He stands out from the other observers.</p>
			<p>Rembrandt knew enough to paint himself into the picture of the cross.</p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget the cross.</p>
			<p>So I run my hand over the contours of the wood. And with each return visit I find my name etched in the bloodstained grain. And I remember, &ldquo;I was once dead, but now I am alive.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And the good news is that&rsquo;s not a clerical error.</p>
			<p>II Corinthians 5:21 says, &ldquo;God made him who had NO sin to be sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s not good news. That&rsquo;s great news!</p>
			<p>My wife Allison called me on my way home from work and said, &ldquo;I just want to prepare you.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Prepare me for what?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Your son&rdquo; (I love when she says that - like Silas isn&rsquo;t her son too!) &ldquo;Your son spray painted a big, orange X on the driveway - and by BIG, I mean BIG!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>To his defense, the day before we had drawn pictures on the driveway using chalk. To his defense, I&rsquo;m the one who left the can of spray paint out.</p>
			<p>So I pull on our street and I&rsquo;m 100 yards from the house and I can already see it. It&rsquo;s like what you would paint on a freeway if you were trying to help a helicopter make an emergency landing!</p>
			<p>X marks the spot.</p>
			<p>When I walked in the house, Silas stood behind his mom. Shame. Fear. All the things that make me want to hide made him want to hide. So I grabbed him and hugged him and said, &ldquo;Hey, X is my favorite letter in the alphabet! If I were going to spray paint a letter on a driveway I would have chosen an X too!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And as long as I live, I&rsquo;ll never forget this - he reached in the front pocket of his camouflaged pants and he pulled out a wad of wrinkled up one-dollar bills that he had been saving to buy a paintball gun with and he handed it to me and started to cry.</p>
			<p>As quickly as he gave it to me, I gave it right back to him.</p>
			<p>I said, &ldquo;Silas, I got this one! This one&rsquo;s on me! Why we don&rsquo;t we go to Lowe&rsquo;s. I bet they have something that can remove a spray paint stain from concrete.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>So we go to Lowe&rsquo;s and we buy a hundred pieces of steel wool and a chemical product and I spend the next four hours on my hands and knees in 30-degree weather scrubbing concrete.</p>
			<p>My brother Jud came to visit a few weeks later and Silas took his uncle by the hand out to the driveway and said, &ldquo;Look, this is where I painted the driveway! And look, it&rsquo;s not there anymore!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>My brother said, &ldquo;Did you clean it off?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Silas said, &ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to make the stain go away&#8230;but my dad was.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>God does what Silas did. God turns stains into stories.</p>
			<p>My friend Greg was stained by alcoholism. God scrubbed the stain away.</p>
			<p>My friend Lisa was stained by prostitution. God scrubbed the stain away.</p>
			<p>My friend Todd was stained by pornography. God scrubbed the stain away.</p>
			<p>God is strong.</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that. Remember that.</p>
			<p>In 1995 I climbed in a car with some friends from college and we drove to the site of the Oklahoma City bombing. We parked our car several blocks away and I remember how quiet it was as we walked toward the epicenter of the blast.</p>
			<p>The FBI put up a chain link fence around the federal building that had been destroyed and it became a memorial of sort for the victims.</p>
			<p>I remember walking slowly, almost cautiously around the block, reading the different tributes. People had placed bundles of flowers and stuffed animals and pictures of loved ones. And towards the end of the fence, a dad who lost his little boy, had paper clipped a picture of his son to the corner of a poster board and with a black magic marker had drawn a rudimentary cross.</p>
			<p>Under the cross he wrote these words: <em>Because of the cross I can forgive Timothy McVeigh. Because of heaven I&rsquo;ll see my son again someday.</em></p>
			<p>Sin puts an X on our hearts.</p>
			<p>Sin holds us hostage to the stain.</p>
			<p>But God forgets our sin.</p>
			<p>We need to remember that God forgets.</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that God forgets.</p>
			<p>He doesn&rsquo;t see the stain. He sees the story.</p>
			<p>In his eyes, your story is not marked by sin. In his eyes, your story is marked by grace.</p>
			<p>Remember that.</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t ever forget that.</p>

			<h1 class="orange">Epilogue: add-verbs</h1>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t just serve. Don&rsquo;t just give. Don&rsquo;t just love.</p>
			<p>Serve <em>joyfully.</em> Give <em>sacrificially.</em> Love <em>recklessly.</em></p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what can happen to your life when you add adverbs. Adverbs add so much to verbs.</p>
			<p>Adverbs like radically, outrageously, spontaneously, abundantly, frequently, honestly, differently, beautifully, secretly, courageously, and generously.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what &ldquo;LY&rdquo; can do to the quality of your life.</p>
			<p>When I read how the people of the Bible lived the word <em>faithfully</em> comes to mind.</p>
			<p>When I look at how most people today are living their lives the word <em>pathetically</em> comes to mind.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a choice. <em>How</em> you live is a choice.</p>
			<p>So <em>how</em> are you going to live?</p>
			<p>Sadly? Boringly? Indecisively? Reluctantly? Fearfully?</p>
			<p>If you live like that, you are not really living.</p>
			<p>How we live will determine how people see Jesus.</p>
			<p>So let me end where I started.</p>
			<p>Jump.</p>
			<p>And don&rsquo;t just jump.</p>
			<p>Add an adverb.</p>
			<p>If it were up to me I would tell you to&#8230;</p>
			<p>&#8230;jump <em>quickly.</em></p>
